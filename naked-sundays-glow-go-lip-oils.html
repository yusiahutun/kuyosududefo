Naked Sundays, a brand known for its commendable <a href=#>fusion of makeup and SPF</a>, is the latest to join in on the fun with the release of its <a href=# rel=nofollow>Glow + Go Lip Oil</a>.</p><p>The brand was kind enough to send me some lip oils to try out—rest assured this is an honest review—and while I wasn’t expecting much more than an average formula at first, my mind changed quickly. First off, the packaging is pretty darn cute; the holographic lettering is a nice touch, and the <a href=# rel=nofollow>actual product</a> inside almost glows through the clear tube. But as always, it’s what’s inside that truly counts.&nbsp;</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/naked-sundays-cherry.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/10/naked-sundays-watermelon.jpg><p>They all have a sweet taste that’s reminiscent of the Lip Smackers of my youth (IYKYK). But beyond bringing an instant juicy pout to your lips, <a href=# rel=nofollow>the product</a> has long-term benefits. Firstly, each lip oil is infused with SPF 50 Broad Spectrum UVA+UVB, so it will protect your lips from the effects of free radicals during wear. It also contains age-defying ingredients like vitamin C, amino acids and lycopene. Raspberry seed oil also helps to minimize the decrease of collagen production, while tomato extract soothes inflammation.&nbsp;</p><p>While many brands are hopping on the wide doe foot applicator train, I appreciate that the one included in these lip oils isn’t massive. In my opinion, it makes it easier to not to apply too much product and to also control where exactly the lip oil goes. Hot tip: Apply a slightly darker lip liner underneath the lip oil to create the perfect illusion of a fuller pout.</p><p>While the lip oils are still generating buzz, reviews have started to appear on the brand’s website. “This was my first purchase and I love the lip oil. It’s not sticky, the color is beautiful and the high SPF was a no brainer! Tastes good too, I want to try them all now,” wrote one reviewer for the watermelon flavor.</p><p>The <a href=# rel=nofollow>Glow + Go Lip Oil</a> is available in coconut, cherry, watermelon and salted caramel for $22 each. You can also purchase a <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">bundle of all four</a> for $66, giving you the fourth one free.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2hpZmp%2FeYKTaKWao5WZerTBzZ2YsqtdnLmww4ygpmakmaV6sLXLrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
