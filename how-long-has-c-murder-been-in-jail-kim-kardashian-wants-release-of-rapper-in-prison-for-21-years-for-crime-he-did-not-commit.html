The brother of rapper Master P has been incarcerated for over two decades, serving a life sentence for a second-degree murder conviction, a crime that Kardashian believes he did not commit.</p><p>Using her platform on social media, the SKIMS founder shared C-Murder's story and drew attention to a recent Louisiana law, Section 926.2. This new law provides an avenue for individuals to present new factual evidence to demonstrate their innocence. Kardashian's advocacy is aimed at raising awareness about this law and its potential implications for Corey's case, as it may grant him the opportunity for a new trial and a chance to prove his innocence.</p><p dir=ltr lang=en>I wanted to shed some light on a case that I’ve been working on for years…</p><p>Corey Miller has spent 21 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, and his conviction is based entirely on the testimony of two men, whom the State dragged to trial just on material witness…</p>— Kim Kardashian (@KimKardashian) <a href=#>August 3, 2023</a><p class=end-of-block-quote>&nbsp;</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>‘So funny’: Internet calls out Kim Kardashian’s ‘fake hard work’ as reality star shares video of working out in gym</a></p><h2 class=split>Kardashian believes lead detective mishandled the case</h2><p>Kardashian said, "I wanted to shed some light on a case that I've been working on for years. Corey Miller has spent 21 years in prison for a crime he did not commit, and his conviction is based entirely on the testimony of two men, who the state dragged to trial just on material witness warrants. Those men have now sworn that their prior testimony was untrue." She continued, "There is no remaining evidence that even suggests that Corey Miller is any more culpable than the hundreds of patrons who were at the Platinum Club on January 12, 2002, when Steve Thomas was tragically shot".</p><p>According to Kardashian, the local sheriff's office handling C-Murder's case focused more on securing a conviction against him rather than diligently searching for the real perpetrator of the crime. She alleges that the lead detective harassed multiple witnesses and mishandled the case to such an extent that it resulted in Miller getting a new trial in 2003 after his initial conviction. In 2009, just four months before the second trial, Miller's attorney attempted to withdraw from the case, citing non-payment for years and expressing dissatisfaction with the situation.</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>‘That Bianca Censori inspo’: Internet thinks Kim Kardashian's new look is inspired by Kanye West's wife</a></p><h2 class=split>Kim Kardashian is advocating alongside Master P</h2><p>Kardashian claimed, “The new judge refused to allow counsel to withdraw, and Mr. Miller stood trial for a second time with an attorney who made no effort to call favorable witnesses to testify. The State's case was minimal, limited to the now recanted testimony of Darnell and Kenneth Jordan, and rather than call the five defense witnesses who testified at the first trial that Mr. Miller was not the shooter, trial counsel played the audio of their testimony for the jury."</p><p><b>Also Read</b>: <a href=#>Kylie Jenner mocked for ‘trying to look’ like Kendall Jenner now after getting ‘sick of looking’ like Kim Kardashian</a></p><p>Indeed, Kim Kardashian is not alone in advocating for Miller. The rapper, known as C-Murder, has received support from various individuals, including his brother Master P, their family members, and his ex-girlfriend Monica Brown. The collective effort to raise awareness and seek justice for Corey underscores the significance of his case and the belief among those close to him that he may have been wrongfully convicted.</p><p><span><b>More from <i>MEAWW</i></b></span></p><p><a href=#>Internet confuses Heather El Moussa with Kim Kardashian as she flaunts same style while sharing 2024's 'ins and outs'</a></p><p><a href=#>Has Kim Kardashian's mobile app finally shut down?
