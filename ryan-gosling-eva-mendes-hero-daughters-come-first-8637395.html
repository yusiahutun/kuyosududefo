The one thing that brings him back down to Earth in those times of doubt is his loved ones, which consists of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>his "hero" Eva Mendes</a> and their two daughters, Esmeralda Amada and Amada Lee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I often think about what's going to matter to me on my deathbed that I did and that I didn't do," Gosling said in a join interview with David Leitch for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Men's Health</a>. "It puts things into perspective. It always comes back to family first. I don't think I'll regret anything professionally, but I do think when it comes to Eva [Mendes] and the girls, they come first."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><figure id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The Barbie actor continued, "I don't know, it's probably not a good thing that I go deathbed, but it's helpful for me. Anytime I'm struggling, I just think about whether it's going to matter to me then because, yeah, this whole thing can be distorting…. Are you going to care about this thing, whether you did it or not, whatever the thing is? It's extreme, but it's helpful."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gosling has been vocal about <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>his family helping him with his work</a>. Following last month's Oscars — during which he gave a rousing performance of his Barbie hit, "I'm Just Ken" — the actor told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>People</a>, "They gave me some tips and some notes, all great notes ... They are such a huge part of this for me...it was my girl's interest in Barbie and disinterest in Ken that got me into this in the first place. It was beautiful to have them there at the end."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK570bKYp2WXpMCttc2gZJ6ukWK6prrDnqpmoJWnvG6wwK6eoayVp8Bur86mnGaemafAtXmXb2pwa2lq</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
