Kardashian chimed in, “My baby looks amazing!”</p><p>The couple were <a href=#>perfectly in sync</a> as they walked the red carpet in New York City in celebration of this year’s <a href=#>“In America: An Anthology of Fashion” theme</a>. The event marked the engaged pair’s first Met Gala appearance together.</p><p>Kardashian and Barker previously chose to <a href=#>forgo the September 2021 gala</a> after going public with their romance earlier that year.</p><p>The <a href=#>Poosh founder</a> revealed at the time that she and the Blink-182 drummer missed the festivities at the Metropolitan Museum of Art to attend <a href=#><strong>Machine Gun Kelly</strong></a>’s concert in Central Park that same day. Barker joined the 32-year-old rapper on stage as the drummer for two songs.</p><p>While the “Tickets to My Downfall” singer’s performance was cut short due to weather issues, Kardashian and Barker didn’t go to any Met Gala afterparties. Instead, they dined at the Polo Bar in the city.</p><p>The <a href=#>Kardashians star</a>, who got engaged to Barker in October 2021, is one of two Kardashian-Jenners sisters who hadn’t been to the coveted fashion night out before Monday’s event. <a href=#><strong>Khloé Kardashian</strong></a> has also been <a href=#>notably absent</a> from fashion’s biggest night for years. <a href=#><strong>Kim Kardashian</strong></a>, <a href=#><strong>Kendall Jenner</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Kylie Jenner</strong></a>, however, have all become staples at the event.</p><p>The Big Apple gala marked the <a href=#>latest PDA-heavy outing</a> for Kourtney and Barker.

The couple surprised fans when they later revealed they <a href=#>had a wedding ceremony</a> at a chapel in Sin City hours after the awards show ended in April.</p><p>The union, however, wasn’t legal since the pair didn’t obtain a marriage license <a href=#>before saying their vows</a> in front of an Elvis impersonator.</p><p>Later that month, Kourtney and Barker <a href=#>brought their blended family</a> to the <a href=#>Kardashians</a> premiere in Los Angeles. The rocker’s two children, Landon, 18, and Alabama, 16, whom he shares with ex-wife <a href=#><strong>Shanna Moakler</strong></a>, were dressed in all black for the affair.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><p>Kourtney, for her part, <a href=#>brought her youngest son</a>, Reign, 7, with her to the event, where he smiled for pictures with his future step siblings.
