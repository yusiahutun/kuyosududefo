Born on <strong>May 15, 2000</strong>, Jackson showcased his lifestyle on his self-titled Instagram account, which has more than 254k (June 3, 2021) followers and earned massive popularity. He is also a big <strong>TikTok star</strong> with 963.2k (June 3 2021) followers. He is known to film TikTok videos during the games and gained more attention during the <strong>Chiefs’ Super Bowl</strong>, where he did the same. Jackson studied at <strong>Whitehouse High School in Texas</strong> and was also a star <strong>athlete</strong>. He played <strong>basketball</strong>. He has stellar shooting ability from range, and a video showed him scoring several three-pointers from different parts of a half-sized backyard court. He even showed off his dribbling in the video and made a move where he tossed a pass to himself off the backboard before slamming it home.</p><p>As it happens, Jackson is pretty athletic himself. However, to explore his sports background, we must return to his high school days. He attended the Whitehouse High School in Texas and spent most of his sports career with basketball. <strong>ETSN reports</strong> that during this time, Jackson contributed as the <strong>second-leading rebounder</strong> for the Wildcats, the school’s varsity team.</p><p>With such a gifted physique, pursuing an athletic career would have been the right choice for Jack, but it seems the guy has other plans.
