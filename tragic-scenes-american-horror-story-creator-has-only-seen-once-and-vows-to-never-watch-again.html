The <a href=#>celebrity</a> who has seen acclaim for his work with American Horror Story The Watcher and Scream Queens is no stranger to knowing what works for great shows. However, Ryan Murphy says the tragedy of Glee meant there was only one episode he could watch once, and he’d never look at it ever again.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-ryan-murphy-says-glee-should-have-ended-with-cory-monteith-s-death>Ryan Murphy says Glee should have ended with Cory Monteith’s death</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/11/GettyImages-173430391-1024x676.jpg><p>Glee creator Ryan Murphy said looking back on the show with hindsight led him to believe the hit musical series should have ended after a star’s death.</p><p>When he joined Glee stars, Jenna Ushkowitz (Tina) and Kevin McHale (Artie), on their podcast, he spoke on how the show handled the tragic death of one of their own.</p><p>Cory Monteith tragically died in 2013. He played the music-loving jock Finn Hudson on the series, who was with <a href=#>Lea Michele</a>‘s character Rachel. The pair also ended up dating for a spell in real life, off-screen. Cory was sadly found dead at the age of 31. An autopsy report noted he died from a combination of drug and alcohol toxicity.</p><p>A month later, the stars returned to film a tribute episode to him and his role, it was called ‘The Quarterback’.</p><p>The show ran from 2009 to 2015, and went on to release six seasons. Cory sadly passed away during season five.</p><p>But Ryan Murphy thinks, looking back, Glee should have taken a break after the tragedy.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-because-you-can-t-really-recover-from-something-like-that>‘Because you can’t really recover from something like that’</h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4>“If I had to do it again, we would’ve stopped for a very long time and probably not come back,” Murphy told Ushkowitz and McHale on their podcast called And That’s What You REALLY Missed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6>If the creator found himself in a similar situation now, he’d end it right there and then.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6>Ryan added: “I would be like, ‘that’s the end’ … Because you can’t really recover from something like that.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6>“It wasn’t, like, a normal death where someone is sick, and you can see them. It happened so quickly with no warning.”</p><p>McHale, who played Artie on set, said he walked out of scenes because it was too hard.</p><p>The show had brought in grief counselors for the stars, but that still didn’t make it any easier.</p><p>“We’re in a scene talking about a character. Obviously, we’re talking about our real friend,” he said. “Then there’s a camera on you. When those things happen, you don’t know when you’re going to lose it and not lose it and break down.”</p><p>Then Ryan replied: “It’s an episode I was able to watch once, and I never looked at it again.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-lea-michele-pays-tribute-to-cory-every-single-year>Lea Michele pays tribute to Cory every single year</h2><p>It wasn’t just Ryan Murphy who was affected by the Glee actor’s death. The Funny Girl star has paid tribute to Cory each and every year on the anniversary of his death. She also has had tattoos inked on her skin in remembrance. She has his character’s jersey number on her side, which she got in 2016. The actress also has ‘Finn’ penned on her lower back in tribute.</p><p>The co-stars fell in love in real life, as well as on screen, and saw a future together.</p><p>A year after Cory’s death, she opened up to <a href=# rel=nofollow>Glamour UK</a>: “We talked about a lot of things. We&nbsp;talked about children&nbsp;and what we would look like when we grew old, and who would be fat and how we would stay thin.”</p><p>Lea went on: “We talked about where we wanted to go and what we wanted to do. We were done. We were it.”</p><p>She added: “When you’re at that place in your life with someone, you talk about everything. But today I feel like I was given the best part of Cory, and I’m thankful for that.”</p><p>This year marked the 10th anniversary, and Lea wrote an emotional post on <a href=#>Instagram</a>.</p><p>She said: “Hey you. 10 years.</p><p>“It feels like only yesterday that you were here and yet a million years ago all at the same time. I hold all of our memories in my heart, where they will stay safe and never forgotten.”</p><p>She continued: “We miss you every day and will never forget the light you too brought to us all. I miss you big guy. I hope you found Taylor [Hawkins] up there and are playing the drums together. 🤍.”</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2WFcMDRmp6im12osKa6xKxkmqWVp7akrc1mn6iqoqS%2Fbr%2FTqKmyZZOnsqLAzqtkoZmjYryvuNhmqp6dnmK8r6%2FEZpinnF2rvLi%2FjK2mZqaVq7Kzedaaq5ygXZa0orXNaA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
