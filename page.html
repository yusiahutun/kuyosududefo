Last month, I shared <a href=#>the trailer for the book</a> and told you all about <a href=#>the book tour that begins the day the book comes out</a> and I promised additional cities would be added. Today is the day! The book tour page — <a href=#>see it in full right here</a>, or click on the image below — now includes Minneapolis, Atlanta, Montreal, Kansas City, Denver, Boulder, Tulsa, Maplewood NJ and an additional book signing in New York City, in addition to the events already planned in Boston, Toronto, Chicago, Philadelphia, Washington DC, Dallas, Austin, Houston, Vancouver, Seattle, Portland, San Francisco, Santa Cruz, and Los Angeles.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5006 height=3337 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/10/quick-pasta-e-ceci-pasta-with-chickpeas.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Pasta e ceci (pasta and chickpeas) is one of Rome’s most iconic dishes, the only dish so essential that it shows up on both Tuesdays and Fridays on <a href=#>the informal meal calendar</a>.* And while there are no two matching ways to make it (a fine excuse to spend as many weeks in Rome as it takes to try them all, if you ask me), the rough guiding recipe principles are fairly consistent: a sautéed base of garlic, sometimes onion, celery and carrot too, and seasonings to which chickpeas, water or chickpea cooking broth, and pasta are added. Some are a more brothy like soup, some blend some chickpeas for a thicker base, some more herby with rosemary or sage, some are light and others are heavy on tomatoes. And then then came <a href=#>Victoria Granof’s</a> version that took the internet by storm over the last couple years as word of it trickled out from her <a href=#>Chickpeas</a> cookbook (which goes so far beyond hummus in ways that only a Le Cordon Bleu-trained chef and famous food stylist would think of) in the lovely <a href=#>Short Stack</a> single ingredient cookbook series.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=5173 height=3449 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/09/chocolate-tahini-challah-buns.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> <a href=#>Challah</a>, that stretchy, rich, lightly sweet, braided glossy bread that’s brushed with egg and baked to an burnished burnt umber shine, like many great traditional foods, does not exist in a vacuum. While challah is a Jewish ceremonial bread, eating on Sabbath and major Jewish holidays, and is usually paerve (dairy product-free, so it’s Kosher regardless of what is being served), pulled away from the Judaic lens, it’s a close cousin to brioche and other enriched breads.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2427 height=1617 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/09/pizza-beans-9952.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Recipe</span></a> Good morning! In less than one month (28 days, not that I’m nervously counting or anything), my second cookbook, <a href=#>Smitten Kitchen Every Day</a>, will be ready to leave warehouses and head to you or your favorite bookstore. <a href=#>A book tour will be quickly under way</a> (I hope we get to meet!).

Then (and I bet this isn’t an unfamiliar story) we had a kid and travel abruptly stopped. What with all of the upbeat stories of angelic children on airplanes, enthusiastically staying seated for 8+ hours and effortlessly adapting to new time zones and cuisines, I can’t imagine how, can you? Plus, between naptimes and nappies and strollers and sippies and snack cups, wouldn’t we just be spending a considerable amount of money just to find a new group of strangers to apologize for our kids-being-kids to?<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><a class=smittenkitchen-thumbnail href=# rel=bookmark><img width=2530 height=1687 src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/149401384.v2.pressablecdn.com/wp-content/uploads//2017/09/smitten-kitchen-every-day-trailer.jpg alt decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class=smittenkitchen-primary-category>Announcements</span></a><p>In 47 days, <a href=#><strong>Smitten Kitchen Every Day: Triumphant & Unfussy New Favorites</strong></a>, my second cookbook, the one it took me <a href=#>five years to write</a> so I’m definitely not freaking out about any of this at all, nope nope nope, will be ready to meet the world.

I have no argument with traditional corn chowder — it has cream, bacon, and potatoes and thus would be impossible not to love as soup or <a href=#>salad</a> — but I adore to the point of boring everyone around me with my gushing, Mexican-style corn either elote-style (on the the cob rolled in butter, mayo, lime juice and coated with salty crumbled cotija cheese and chile powder or a chile-lime seasoning blend) or esquites-style (all of the above, but in a cup). This corn chowder attempts to celebrate the best of both.<p><a class=more-link href=#>Read more <span>»</span></a></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirnZ7BtbHNpKCtm5iau2%2BvzqZmqZmXmnxzf454rqudlnKvqrI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
