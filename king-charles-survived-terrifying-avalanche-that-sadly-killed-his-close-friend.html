He first visited in 1978, when he was dating Lady Sarah Spencer at the time before courting her younger sister who would go on to become <a href=#>Princess Diana</a>. Set in the picturesque alps, it’s a two-hour train ride through the mountains before skiers reach the famous resort, near Davos. <a href=#>King Charles</a> would venture to the mountain to enjoy the slopes regularly, but it was one fateful avalanche in 1988 that left a mark on his life.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/03/GettyImages-52513860-1024x646.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-king-charles-lost-his-dear-friend-in-devastating-avalanche>King Charles lost his dear friend in devastating avalanche</h2><p>On March 10 that year, Charles was skiing in Klosters with a group on an unmarked trail when an avalanche came tumbling towards the king and his pals.</p><p>The now monarch survived, but Patricia Palmer-Tomkinson, a member of their group was injured seriously.</p><p>His close friend, Major Hugh Lindsay, sadly died.</p><p>The event was mentioned by the <a href=#>Netflix</a> series that followed the royals.
