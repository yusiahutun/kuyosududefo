Maybe someone told you how dead symbolic links take up space on your storage device and now you want to get rid of them for good.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Luckily, there are several utilities available that you can download on your Linux computer in order to manage symbolic links. These tools will also help you in finding broken soft links and fixing them permanently.</p><p>Here we will discuss how you can report and fix broken symbolic links on your system using <strong>symlinks</strong> and <strong>find</strong> command.</p><h2 id=what-are-symlinks-and-how-do-i-create-one>What Are Symlinks and How Do I Create One?</h2><p>Generally, every computer system has two types of links---soft links and hard links. Hard links are directory entries that link a specific name with a file present on your system. These are the original files that are stored in a particular address on your storage.</p><p>On the other hand, soft links are text strings that link two directories or files with each other. Program shortcuts are a great example of symbolic links. Suppose, file A has a symbolic link with file B. This means that file A will store the absolute or relative path to file B.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Create a Symlink in Linux</a></span></p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>To create a symlink:</p><li>Launch the terminal by pressing <strong>Ctrl</strong> + <strong>Alt</strong> + <strong>T</strong> on your keyboard.</li><li>Create a new text file named <strong>text.txt</strong>.<pre><code class="hljs bash">touch text.txt</code> </pre></li><li>Link another text file (<strong>another.txt</strong>) with the file you've just created (<strong>text.txt</strong>).<pre><code class="hljs bash">ln -s text.txt another.txt</code> </pre></li><p>You just linked two different text files together using a symbolic link. The <strong>ln</strong> command is the default way of creating symbolic links on a Linux-based operating system. The <strong>-s</strong> in the above-mentioned command stands for symbolic links.</p><p><span class=related-single>Related: <a href=#>How to Use the ls Command in Linux</a></span></p><p>The major problem with symbolic links is, if you delete or move the target file, the symbolic link is not removed automatically. Instead, the link now points to a file that is not even present on your system. Such links are known as dangling, broken, orphaned, or dead links.</p><h2 id=find-and-fix-broken-symlinks>Find and Fix Broken Symlinks</h2><p>First, you need to confirm that a symbolic link exists in the system. You can easily do that using the <strong>ll</strong> and <strong>grep</strong> command.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><pre><code class="hljs bash">ll | grep txt</code> </pre><p>The above command will list down all the symlinks associated with text files in your current working directory.</p><p>Now, if we were to break the symlink we've created above by deleting the parent text file (<strong>text.txt</strong>):</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">rm text.txt</code> </pre><p>The symlink will break and is not removed from your system. You can confirm this by typing the <strong>ll | grep txt</strong> command in your terminal again.</p><p>Although a couple of broken symlinks won't do any harm to your computer, this can gradually become a thousand in no time. That's why there is a need to monitor dangling links on your system.</p><p>The only way to fix these broken symlinks is by deleting them. Your system contains hundreds of dangling links and no one has the time to check for these links manually. In such cases, Linux tools and commands prove to be really helpful.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=using-symlinks>Using Symlinks</h3><p>Symlinks is a powerful utility that provides you with all the tools you need to manage and fix broken symlinks on your system. Since it is not installed on most of the Linux distributions by default, you will have to install it manually.</p><p>You can use Pacman to <a href=#>install the package on Arch Linux</a>:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo pacman -S symlinks</code> </pre><p>On Fedora:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo dnf install symlinks</code> </pre><p>On CentOS:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo yum install symlinks</code> </pre><p>On Debian based distributions:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo apt-get install symlinks</code> </pre><p>If you are running Ubuntu, before installing the symlinks package, you will have to add the universe repository to your system's repository list.</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo add-apt-repository universe</code> </pre><p>After you have successfully installed symlinks, you need to check for orphaned links on your system. To do so, enter:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">symlinks .</code> </pre><p>The <strong>. (dot)</strong> character refers to the current working directory. If you want to report broken symlinks in your <strong>/home</strong> directory, you can do it by typing in:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">symlinks /home</code> </pre><p>If a broken link is present on your system, you will get an output that looks something like this.</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">dangling: /home/sharmadeepesh/another.txt -&gt; test.txt</code> </pre><p>To quickly delete the reported symlink, you can use the <strong>-d</strong> flag with the default command.</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">symlinks -d .</code> </pre><p>To delete dangling symlinks in the<strong> /home</strong> directory, enter:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><pre><code class="hljs bash">symlinks -d /home</code> </pre><p>This time, the output will not only list down the broken link but will also report that the link is now deleted.</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">dangling: /home/sharmadeepesh/another.txt -&gt; test.txt<br>deleted: /home/sharmadeepesh/another.txt -&gt; test.txt</code> </pre><p>To report and delete broken symbolic links in a given directory recursively, use the <strong>-dr</strong> flag with the default command, where <strong>d</strong> stands for delete and <strong>r</strong> stands for recursive.</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">symlinks -dr .</code> </pre><h3 id=using-the-find-command>Using the Find Command</h3><p>The <strong>find</strong> command comes preinstalled on every Linux system. As the name suggests, you can <a href=#>search for folders and files</a> using this command. The <strong>find</strong> command allows you to report and delete dead soft links on your system easily as well.</p><p>To list down broken symbolic links in your current working directory, type:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">find . -xtype l</code> </pre><p>To find broken links present in any other directory on your system, just replace the<strong> . (dot)</strong> character with the directory path. The following command will search for broken links in the <strong>/home</strong> directory.</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">find /home -xtype l</code> </pre><p>You can also list down the broken symlinks that are not used by your system.</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">find . -xtype l ! -<span class=hljs-built_in>exec</span>&nbsp;<span class=hljs-built_in>test</span> -e {} \; -<span class=hljs-built_in>print</span></code> </pre><p>To check where these broken links point, use:</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><pre><code class="hljs bash">find . -xtype l -<span class=hljs-built_in>exec</span> ls -l {} \+<br></code> </pre><p>Depending on the amount of broken symbolic links on your system, you will get an output that looks something like this.</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">lrwxrwxrwx 1 root root 19 Feb 21 11:53 /home/sharmadeepesh/another.txt -&gt; /home/sharmadeepesh/text.txt</code> </pre><p>Furthermore, you can delete broken symbolic links in one go with the following command.</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo find . -xtype l -delete<br></code> </pre><p>There's an alternative way to delete dead links as well:</p><pre><code class="hljs bash">sudo find . -xtype l ! -<span class=hljs-built_in>exec</span>&nbsp;<span class=hljs-built_in>test</span> -e {} \; -delete<br></code> </pre><h2 id=managing-symbolic-links-in-linux>Managing Symbolic Links in Linux</h2><p>Symbolic Links are important to a Linux system as they ease out the process of path resolution and management on your computer. But if not taken care of, broken symbolic links can take up a huge chunk of your system storage and you won't even know about it. In such situations, utilities such as <strong>symlinks</strong> and <strong>find</strong> come into play.</p><p>If you are a beginner and want to improve your expertise in Linux, then learning new commands every now and then is the perfect approach to go for. Users should know which command they need in order to solve a given situation efficiently.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGifqK9dqbxussinm2aZnpl6p7XXZpmrp5uau26%2F2KajoqabqHqquoyloKetqGQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
