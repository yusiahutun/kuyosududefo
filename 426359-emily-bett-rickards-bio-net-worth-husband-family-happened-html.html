Furthermore, there are no known Emily Bett Rickards' boyfriends of the past. However, between 2014 and 2015, rumours emerged that Emily was dating her co-star Colton Haynes.</p><p class=align-left>Initially, the tabloids thought they were friends since they hanged around together during filming and even posted about each other on their social media platforms. In addition, two went on holiday in Greece, leading many to conclude that they were a couple. But in May 2016, Colton Haynes <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">declared he was gay,</a> ending the rumours that he was in a relationship with Emily.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a67b0fe2dea34767.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Barbara Bain: husband, daughter, net worth, movies and TV shows</span></p></a><p class=align-left>In 2016, rumours also emerged that Emily Bett Rickards was dating actress Aisha Tyler. The two made many red carpets together after first meeting in 2015. They immediately bonded and became best of friends.

They talked of being in love but did not confirm their relationship openly. Both Emily Bett Rickards and Aisha Tyler have never confirmed their sexual orientation.
