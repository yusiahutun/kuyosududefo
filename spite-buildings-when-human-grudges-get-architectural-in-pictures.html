Their origins are often disputed, occasionally embellished and usually entertaining, revealing tales of spurned lovers, fraternal feuds and vengeance. Below we highlight a few of the most famous of these “malicious erections” (sorry).</p><h2 id=kavanagh-building-buenos-aires-1936>Kavanagh Building, Buenos Aires, 1936</h2><figure id=a9e6187b-b133-4eb0-b0fd-9c5d7c9efece data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><ul><li>Photograph: Alamy<br></li></ul></span></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>At 33 floors, this art deco skyscraper was for a time the tallest building in South America. Corina Kavanagh, a millionaire of Irish descent who had made her money from property deals, was engaged to a member of the aristocratic Anchorena family. The “old money” family disapproved of a relationship with a “new money” woman, and the couple were pressured into separating. Kavanagh vowed revenge. The Anchorenas lived in a local palace (now home to the Argentine foreign ministry) and had built a private church nearby, so Kavanagh instructed an architect to design a skyscraper that would <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">block the Anchorenas’ view of their church</a>.</p><figure id=b5e6fb6f-09c3-4b32-a81e-154a1985d226 data-spacefinder-role=immersive data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-2xrvww><h2 class=dcr-njrrls>Inat Kuca (Spite House), Sarajevo, 1879</h2><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><ul><li>Photograph: Alamy<br></li></ul></span></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>When the Austro-Hungarian empire took control of Sarajevo in 1878, it set about erecting buildings in prime locations, including a planned new town hall on the banks of the river Miljacka. One problem: a man named Benderija who lived by the river refused to leave his home. Eventually Benderija cut a deal: he would leave in exchange for a giant bag of coins and a promise that his home would be moved brick by brick to the opposite bank of the river. It was said the old man sat each day on a nearby bridge smoking and carefully observing the relocation. The building soon became a symbol of Bosnian defiance, <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">and is now home to a restaurant</a> popular with tourists.<br></p><figure id=e832fd1e-ca20-4e7b-8c89-9a072503ebc2 data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><h2 class=dcr-17hk1wk>Al Ba’sa (The Grudge), Beirut, 1954</h2><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><ul><li>Photograph: Sandra Rishani<br></li></ul></span></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Perhaps unsurprisingly, feuding brothers are one of the most common sources of spite buildings around the world.

In 1908 the city of Alameda in the San Francisco Bay Area was expanding. The story goes that <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">the city requisitioned two-thirds of a plot of land belonging to Charles Froling</a>, a carpenter, with the help of Froling’s neighbour, and paved a road. The embittered Froling took revenge on the neighbour by constructing a three-metre-wide, 16-metre-long house on the thin slice of land he had left.</p><h2 id=montlake-pie-house-seattle-1925>Montlake ‘pie house’, Seattle, 1925</h2><figure id=2889cb37-bb04-41c0-9543-94664ed5a5aa data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl></figure><figure id=e08de753-3e74-4ca7-8ba3-38a11a9a137b data-spacefinder-role=inline data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.MultiImageBlockElement class=dcr-173mewl><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><ul><li>Photographs: Planomatic<br></li></ul></span></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>There are often competing origin stories for spite buildings, and this tiny Seattle house has several. The best centres on an inequitable divorce settlement. A judge awarded the separating couple’s house to the husband, while the wife had to settle for the front garden. In protest the wife <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">constructed a house on the sliver of land, in the shape of a slice of pie,</a>with a tiny room only 1.4 metres wide at one end.</p><h2 id=candy-striped-townhouse-london-2015>Candy-striped townhouse, London, 2015</h2><figure id=49cfea7b-7730-4cd6-8f07-c7ea1ecd7b3f data-spacefinder-role=immersive data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-2xrvww><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><ul><li>Photograph: PA</li></ul></span></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Better-established planning laws (as well as a British preference for more indirect aggression) means there are few examples of spite buildings in the UK. But property developer Zipporah Lisle-Mainwaring <a href=# data-link-name="in body link">made headlines when she gave a garish red and white paint job to her Kensington townhouse</a> after neighbours objected to her plans to demolish and rebuild the property.

One of the men returned from fighting in the American civil war to find his brother had built a house taking up most of the plot of land. So he quickly constructed his own skinny house on the remaining land, blocking out the sunlight and his brother’s view in the process. The four-storey house is a little over nine metres deep and just three metres wide, and is now a beloved local fixture.</p><figure id=3704f76c-d272-4010-aedc-d93f316fda21 data-spacefinder-role=immersive data-spacefinder-type=model.dotcomrendering.pageElements.ImageBlockElement class=dcr-2xrvww><h2 class=dcr-njrrls>Plum Island beach house, Newburyport, 1925</h2><span class=dcr-1qvd3m6><ul><li>Photograph: Getty Images<br></li></ul></span></figure><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>A woman is said to have consented to a divorce from her husband only if he would build for her an exact duplicate of the home they shared in Massachusetts.
