Melbourne mum Leane Flynn, 55, died on Tuesday surrounded by her husband Justin and their three daughters.
She was a 'picture of health' and had just come home from a 10km run one morning in 2017 when she was diagnosed with stage three ovarian cancer.
She was given five years to live after two soft drink can-sized tumours were found on her ovaries, with another the size of a banana on her liver."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

The key is their persistence and severity.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>&nbsp;Common signs and symptoms of ovarian cancer include:</p><ul class=mol-bullets-with-font><li>&nbsp;Abdominal Bloating: Persistent and unexplained bloating, especially if it's accompanied by a feeling of fullness or pressure in the abdomen, can be a sign of ovarian cancer.</li><li>&nbsp;Pelvic or Abdominal Pain: Ongoing pelvic or abdominal pain, which may be vague or sharp, is another symptom to watch for. It can range from mild to severe.</li><li>Difficulty Eating: If you experience a loss of appetite or a feeling of early fullness when eating, it could be a sign of ovarian cancer.&nbsp;</li><li>Frequent Urination: An increase in the frequency and urgency of urination, without an apparent urinary tract infection, can be a symptom.&nbsp;</li><li>Changes in Bowel Habits: Changes in bowel habits, such as diarrhea or constipation, that persist for an extended period without an obvious cause may be associated with ovarian cancer.&nbsp;</li><li>Unexplained Weight Loss: Significant, unintentional weight loss can be a sign of various underlying health issues, including ovarian cancer.&nbsp;</li><li>Fatigue: Ongoing fatigue or low energy levels that don't improve with rest should be investigated by a healthcare professional.&nbsp;</li><li>Pain During Sexual Intercourse: Pain or discomfort during sexual intercourse, which is not explained by other factors, can be a symptom.&nbsp;</li><li class=class>Back Pain: Some women with ovarian cancer may experience lower back pain as a symptom, although this is less common.&nbsp;</li></ul><p class=mol-para-with-font>Testing for ovarian cancer typically involves a combination of medical history assessment, physical examination, and various diagnostic tests. It's important to note that there is no single screening test that is highly effective for detecting ovarian cancer in its early stages for the general population.&nbsp;</p>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/femail/none/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span> <img id=i-c10105b5955b571c src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/1s/2023/09/07/22/75187531-12493689-Leae_Flynn_candidly_opened_up_about_her_cancer_ordeal_to_spread_-a-1_1694123007581.jpg height=794 width=634 alt="Leae Flynn candidly opened up about her cancer ordeal to spread public awareness" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Leae Flynn candidly opened up about her cancer ordeal to spread public awareness</p><h3 class=mol-factbox-title>READ MORE:&nbsp;<a style=font-weight:700 class=class href=#>&nbsp;Jenna had her entire life plan mapped out.
