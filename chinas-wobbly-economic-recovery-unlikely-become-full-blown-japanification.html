Since peaking in late January, the MSCI China index has plunged more than 18 per cent, compared with a 4 per cent rise in the FTSE All-World Index, a gauge of global shares.Concerns about the <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">unevenness of China’s recovery</span></a> have turned into deep misgivings about the underpinnings of growth and the timeliness and effectiveness of stronger monetary and fiscal stimulus. Morgan Stanley, one of a dwindling number of China bulls, said in a report published on June 20 that “we think it is fair to say without exaggeration that in our years of tracking China, investor sentiment has never been as bearish as it is now.”This is partly because of mounting fears that China’s economy is suffering from the same malaise that plagued Japan following the bursting of <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">its epic asset bubble</span></a> in the early 1990s. To this day, that financial shock prevents the world’s third-largest economy from experiencing strong and sustained growth.One of the most compelling analyses of what happened to Japan is the “balance sheet recession” concept pioneered by Richard Koo, chief economist at the Nomura Research Institute. This is when monetary policy becomes ineffective because <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">highly indebted households</span></a> and companies are focused on paying down debt and are reluctant to consume and invest, even when interest rates fall sharply.Not only is there strong evidence that this phenomenon was responsible for Japan’s post-bubble <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">stagnation and deflation</span></a>, signs of such a slump were also apparent in the euro zone and the United States following the 2008 financial crash. <img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/05/03/2023-05-01T003505Z_1_LOV817827042023RP1_RTRMADV_STREAM-8256-16X9-MP4_JAPAN-ECONOMY-WAGES.MP4_.00_01_24_25.Still002.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">02:07</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Japan’s small-sized firms struggle to offer higher pay to keep up with inflation</p><p>Japan’s small-sized firms struggle to offer higher pay to keep up with inflation</p>In the past decade, there were suggestions that China – whose non-financial corporate debt has surged since the 2008 crisis, whose economic model is characterised by overinvestment, a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">high savings rate</span></a> and suppressed consumption and whose <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">property bubble</span></a> has begun to deflate – <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">could be turning Japanese</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Koo revived these fears last month when he warned that China was likely to enter a balance sheet recession and needed to take urgent action to head off a protracted, Japanese-style downturn.</p>He is not the only economist sounding the alarm <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">over “Japanification”</span></a>. Citigroup, which warned earlier this year that today’s China looks “strikingly similar” to post-bubble Japan, said last week that China was on the brink of a “confidence trap as the reopening impulse starts to fade”.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/05/03/2023-05-01T003505Z_1_LOV817827042023RP1_RTRMADV_STREAM-8256-16X9-MP4_JAPAN-ECONOMY-WAGES.MP4_.00_01_24_25.Still002.jpg>What is particularly worrying is that China appears to be stuck in a liquidity trap, whereby a dearth of willing and solvent borrowers renders <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">cuts in interest rates</span></a> ineffective. Only more forceful fiscal stimulus – mainly to boost consumption by restoring confidence in a property market where developers have yet to complete unfinished projects – can avert a downward spiral.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Given how bleak sentiment towards China is right now, these fears risk becoming self-fulfilling. Yet, the differences between China and Japan are far more consequential than the similarities.</p>First, because Chinese policymakers are sensitive to the mistakes made by Japan, it is unlikely they would allow a full-blown balance sheet recession to take hold. Beijing has had plenty of time to learn from <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Tokyo’s costly policy blunders</span></a>.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China can’t afford to wait and see about economic stimulus</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Second, comparisons between China and Japan are inapt in several crucial areas. Not only did Japan allow the yen to strengthen sharply in the years preceding and following the bursting of its bubble, it kept real interest rates above the rate of economic growth and maintained an overly restrictive fiscal stance in the 1990s.</p>By contrast, China carefully manages its currency, ensuring the yuan trades in a tight range versus other major currencies. More importantly, China benefits from its state-owned financial system that makes a systemic crisis in the banking sector highly unlikely. Furthermore, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">strict controls</span></a> on the country’s capital account significantly reduce the risk of major capital flight.Third, the declines in asset prices in China, particularly in the property market, have been nowhere near as catastrophic as the falls in Japan in 1990 and the US in 2008. Beijing’s penchant for control – as opposed to Japan’s more market-driven system – not only provides a financial backstop, it helps buy China time to shift to a <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">consumption-driven growth</span></a> model, a conceivable prospect given that it still has plenty of economic catching-up to do.To be sure, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">worrying demographic trends</span></a>, acute geopolitical tensions and much deeper global economic integration than in the 1990s make China more vulnerable in some respects.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Yet, the bigger the vulnerabilities, the stronger the likelihood that Beijing will deliver the necessary fiscal stimulus to kick-start growth. Renewed fears of a balance sheet recession in China could be the necessary catalyst to force Beijing’s hand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">Nicholas Spiro is a partner at Lauressa Advisory</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ksLC5zJ6lrWefpbavtc6nZpqqpJ6wrbGObGlrbmdrgHCvx6KlmqtdrLyjrsuyZJ6bn6O8rrXCZqmem5%2BrsrPFjK6lpaGbmrm6ecGemqillWKztrjLZpmlp6ejequtz5qlop6ZmK61tc6n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
