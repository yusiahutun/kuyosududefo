But, if that simple reminder isn’t enough, perhaps hearing from some of the industry’s top celebrity hairstylists will do the trick.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Ahead, find 13 cool hairstyles for women over 50, according to the pros.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-long-and-natural></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Long and Natural</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Gone are the days of turning 50 and feeling pressured to cut off your hair and cover your grays. Nowadays, celebrity hairstylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Voël Hair Extensions</a>, Kimberly Gueldner, who is Amy Schumer’s personal hairstylist, says that letting your hair grow in its natural texture and color is in.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Andie Macdowell</a> is a perfect example of this," she says. "She looks gorgeous with her long, gray, natural hair.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you have <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>naturally curly</a> or wavy hair, Gueldner recommends adding in layers to help accentuate the texture while also reducing some of the bulk. “This look is great for women with naturally curly hair who don't want to blow dry it straight all the time — it’s low maintenance,” she says. “To recreate this look, you can scrunch in oil or cream and let [your hair] air dry. Once dry, you can grab pieces and wrap them with a one-inch iron to define your curls even more.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-curtain-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Curtain Bangs</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Celebrity hairstylist and founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Phenix Salon Suites</a> <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Gina Rivera</a>, says that bangs are an instant ticket to a more youthful look. “Longer is often better,” she admits. “A longer, side-swept bang or curtain bang allows for versatility when styling."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dove partner and celebrity stylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Ursula Stephen</a> agrees, noting that Laverne Cox is a wonderful example of how this style can play out on long hair.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I love this cut; it’s sexy and sophisticated,” she says. “This cut is ideal for a rectangular face shape. It really helps to soften the face. It works well for fine and straight hair.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It’s easy to style at home, too. Simply blow out your hair and curl it with a large-barrel curling iron (or a smaller one if you have fine hair that easily falls flat, as the smaller coil will take longer to unfurl).</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-easy-updo></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Easy Updo</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Whether you’re headed to the office, a party, or a red carpet event —&nbsp;or you simply want to feel beautifully put together — Gueldner suggests an updo. But don’t be intimidated! Not all updos are incredibly intricate and time-sucking, and they're not the prom fare you remember from your youth.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“For a casual updo, I love this style that Halle Berry is rocking,” she shares. “These casual styles have been very popular recently and work on any hair length.” Plus, since it’s as simple as pinning your hair back with a few face-framing strands, it’s quite simple to DIY. “For those who might not wear their hair up often, going for something like this is an easy way to create a fresher look if you are looking for an easy change,” Gueldner adds. “A style like this is a great look for women with finer hair because it does not require extremely tight styling.” To achieve the look, she says to blow-dry bangs with a round brush and part them down the middle. Next, add a bit more definition by curling face-framing pieces with a quarter-inch iron. Once you’ve done that, pin the rest back, et voila!</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-tousled-waves></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Tousled Waves</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Celebrity hairstylist <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dominick Pucciarello</a> likes adding layers to a long cut to boost volume, movement, and create more dimension to balance out the look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When styling medium-to-long hair, Gueldner loves a tousled look, like Michelle Pfeiffer's. “As we age, I enjoy seeing women move away from coiffed looks and go edgy,” she says. “It's super sexy, and I love the idea of just going with what we are confident with and what makes us feel good rather than having to fit a particular ideal as we age.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Fortunately for all, this look is easy to recreate. “Blow dry hair with a round brush and wrap sections of hair with a one quarter-inch iron,” Gueldner says. Then, if you find your tresses need a little holding power, use a texture spray or light-hold hairspray.&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-wispy-textured-pixie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Wispy Textured Pixie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If you want to go short, David says a wispy textured pixie is the way to go. “This particular haircut is popular amongst our clients who want a stylish yet low-maintenance hairstyle similar to Kris Jenner's signature cut,” he says. “Incorporating textured spray or paste helps to piece together and create texture.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Rivera concurs, noting that product is essential when styling a pixie. “It supports the definition of the cut,” she explains. “Adding bangs to your pixie can take it to a whole new level as it lays the foundation for an array of different styling opportunities. Think jagged, side-swept, and blunt. There’s a lot to choose from.&nbsp; And don’t be afraid to play with hair color when it comes to this style.&nbsp;A professional colorist can enhance this look which provides another dimension of versatility.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-cropped-pixie-with-volume-on-top></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Cropped Pixie with Volume On Top</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_34-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For an edgier, younger-looking pixie that’s perfectly appropriate on people of all ages, consider a cropped pixie with a little more on top. “I personally love this for women with a diamond-shaped face, because it has more volume on top, with tapered sides, and helps balance the angular face shape by creating a more harmonious shape overall,” says celebrity hairstylist and DIY expert for Sally Beauty, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Gregory Patterson</a>. Since the shorter sides highlight the scalp, he says that scalp care is key with this cut.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sleek-high-ponytail></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_36-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sleek High Ponytail</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The beauty of this ponytail hairstyle is that all hair types can enjoy it, as the seek portion is from the roots to the pony. From there, you can opt for a fully sleek style or embrace your natural texture, as Taraji P. Henson did above.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For best results, David says to start with clean hair. Using a flat iron, straighten your hair from your roots to about six inches down (or however far it takes to reach the crown of your head). Then, using a soft boar bristle brush, smooth the hair back into a high ponytail. From there, you can coif your pony to your liking. To keep the sleek portion looking its best, though, David recommends spritzing on hairspray to take flyaways and keep the style locked in place.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-blunt-bob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Blunt Bob</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">A well-styled bob is another beautiful style for women over 50. “I love a classic bob because it works on mostly all face shapes and works well with straight, wavy, and, curly hair,” Stephen says. “It can be worn with a side or middle part, [as well as] worn off the face.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When opting for a bob, Stephen loves a style with blunt ends. “As we get older our hair tends to thin, so a blunt cut like the bob helps hair to feel and look thicker,” she explains.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To recreate this exact bob, Stephen says to start with clean hair and apply the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dove Hair Therapy Brilliant Gloss & Repair Serum</a> with the Dove Hair Therapy 7-in-1 Miracle Mist. “This will help repair and strengthen hair, leaving it shiny and smooth,” she says.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-middle-part></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Middle Part</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">David says middle parts can look lovely at every age. “Jennifer Aniston's iconic hairstyle is one of the most sought-after hairstyles,” he says. “Hair parted in the middle while having layers frame the face [helps] complement the jawline.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shaggy-bangs></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_49-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Shaggy Bangs</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_51-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bangs don’t have to be flawlessly blown out ​​to look great. Stephen says that shaggy bangs add a certain allure to a hairstyle. “[Shaggy bangs with shoulder-length waves is a] very flattering [hairstyle],” she says. To get the look, she says to simply let your hair air dry, then add sea salt spray to amp up the texture before flat ironing the bangs.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-asymmetric-pixie></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_52-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Asymmetric Pixie</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_53-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_54-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While many pixie cuts are styled to look as though there isn’t a part, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Pucciarello</a> says that a sharp side part can be stylish and unexpected. Whether you slick each side of your part or coif it into a pompadour, he says the result is always “fun, youthful, and chic.”</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-angled-textured-bob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_55-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Angled, Textured Bob</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_56-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_57-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Don’t feel like your bob has to be sleek and high-shine for it to work. According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Pucciarello</a>, adding layers and angles to a pixie can work wonders. To style the cut, he says to use a curling iron at the ends of the hair in the uppermost layer of hair. Shake it out, use a little texture spray, and marvel over the volume and movement you can achieve in such a short time.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-blown-out-bob></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_58-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-list-item-title"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Blown Out Bob</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_59-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_60-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a more retro, voluminous look, blow out your bob. “This bob is a classic and will always make you look spectacular and trendy,” says Dove partner and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrity hair stylist Rocco</a>. Best of all, it’s very easy to style at home, as you just need a round brush and a blow dryer to make magic happen.
