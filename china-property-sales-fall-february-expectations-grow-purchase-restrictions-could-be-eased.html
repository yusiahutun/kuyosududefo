This is because a temporary, modest boost in home sales from the latest rounds of local government policy relaxation released in August and September – including removal of home purchase and mortgage restrictions – has diminished,” wrote analysts at Fitch Ratings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">State-owned Poly Developments saw its sales drop 54.1 per cent year on year in February, while Shenzhen government-backed China Vanke recorded a 52.1 per cent decline.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">China’s home prices fall at a slower pace as Beijing moves to resuscitate sector</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile, top private developers like Country Garden saw a 78 per cent year-on-year decline in sales in February, while Longfor Group saw its sales fall by 55 per cent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The collapsing sales are not just a reflection of weak homebuyer confidence but also the result of efforts to reorient the economy away from the previous over-dependence on property for driving growth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We continue to believe that a turnaround of the property sector ultimately hinges on whether home sales can stabilise,” said Nomura. “While there may be some expectation by the capital market that more tier-1 cities, namely Beijing and Shanghai, could relax their local home-purchase restrictions, we choose not to put too much weight on such expectations for policies.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This seems to be the widespread belief among China watchers, as Moody’s Analytics analysts say “things will get worse before they get better”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Still, we do not expect the ‘three red lines’ policy – an intervention made in August 2020 that placed restrictions on property developers – to be entirely dropped,” said Sarah Tan and Harry Murphy Cruise, economists at Moody’s Analytics.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Support through the supply side could take the form of expediting construction of unfinished properties via more funding for the property sector. Meanwhile, efforts to boost demand could bring another (round of) easing of restrictions for first-time homebuyers and a reduction of the down payment ratio.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Meanwhile sentiment among homebuyers remains uncertain amid mounting evidence of increased consumer caution.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Despite developers’ marketing efforts, demand is still weak and buyers remain on the sidelines, and this is due largely to uncertainties in income expectations and volatility in the market,” said Liu Shui, a director of corporate research at China Index Academy, a real estate research firm.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We expect to see more favourable support measures being rolled out after the ‘two sessions,’ with tier-one cities seeing more demand-side easing measures, while tier-two cities will see complete relaxation of purchase restrictions.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kvbO7z56prbFflr%2B1tcKlnGhrYmqAeIOWaJqhoZ6WerG%2Bzqmcq6ypYsCiuMSsZJ%2BZnKF6p7HBq6yaqqlisrm8xJyrmqyZpLu0ecarprBloKq%2FpLTArJxmqpWowbO1wq2gqKajYrCwwcudZJudXZqutLHD</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
