Gwen Yearwood died early Saturday morning after a long battle with cancer. <span id=more-49502></span></p><p>"Mrs. Gwen Yearwood ended her long battle with cancer early Saturday morning with her two daughters at her side," a statement at Yearwood's official <a href=#>website</a> reads. "The family is deeply appreciative of the care and concern they’ve received throughout this journey. As a long-time supporter of the Susan G. Komen Foundation, Trisha asks that expressions of sympathy be directed to Komen’s research, in her mother’s name."</p><p>Just recently, Yearwood told <a href=#>GAC</a> how influential her parents -- including the late Jack Yearwood -- were in her life. "I'm very lucky. I'm one of those kids who has a mom who everybody loves. So when my mom comes to Oklahoma and visits and she's gone, everybody's like, 'When's your mom coming back?'" she said.</p><p>Gwen Yearwood was the cook in the family, and played a large roll in grooming her daughter to be a recognized kitchen expert. Along with Yearwood's sister, the two co-authored two cookbooks, 'Georgia Cooking in an Oklahoma Kitchen' and 'Home Cooking with Trisha Yearwood.'</p><p>Gwen Yearwood was a retired school teacher, and she encouraged her daughter to pursue education before chasing her dream in Nashville. The singer credits her degree from Belmont University for helping her maintain a long career in Nashville.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmraqZqLWiediemKuvn6SxbrnOrZ%2Beql2cxKa6jLKcmqqnpLylecOinKxn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
