Even then, we were impressed with its sleek design and awarded it our MUO Best in CES award. A few months later, we have an engineering sample ready to review.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The MSI Stealth 16 Studio targets creative professionals who need a high-performance machine to run demanding applications.

Its powerful hardware, beautiful design, and excellent port selection make it a great choice not only for creators but also for gamers and anyone who wants a powerful, lightweight, and portable laptop without sacrificing screen size or connectivity.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-speakers.jpg><h2 id=design>Design</h2><p>The laptop is available in two colors: Pure White, or Star Blue. On the base of the rear, there is an elegant Stealth logo printed against a shiny mirror-like material. It is very reminiscent of the Lincoln logo found on its premium SUVs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-left-io.jpg><p>Additionally, the Stealth 16 Studio A13V is built to last, with a durable Magnesium-Aluminum Alloy chassis that is ultra-light at just 1.99kg (4.39lbs) and ultra-slim at 19.95mm (0.79 inches), making it easy to take on the go.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-top-lid.jpg><p>The MSI Stealth 16 Studio A13V features Steel Series per-key RGB lighting. You have several presets to choose from, including reactive keys when pressed.

You'll likely still want to use a good pair of noise-canceling headphones with the Studio 16 once the fans kick in.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-vents.jpg><h2 id=connectivity>Connectivity</h2><p>The MSI Stealth 16 Studio (A13Vx) offers an impressive selection of I/O ports to accommodate various needs. On the laptop's left side, you will find Ethernet, a full-size HDMI port, a Thunderbolt 4 Type-C port, and a microSD card reader.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-blade-17-vents.jpg><p>On the right side are two USB 3.2 Gen 2 Type-A ports, a 3.5 mm audio jack, and a DC-in jack. The Thunderbolt 4 Type-C port provides fast data transfer speeds and allows for connecting to external displays.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The full-size HDMI port is a valuable addition for those who need to connect to a monitor or TV without a dongle. That said, creators would have probably appreciated a full-size SD card reader instead of the microSD one found. This would be more convenient for quickly transferring files from cameras and most other professional recording devices which still use the full-size format. Despite this, the selection of I/O ports on the Stealth 16 Studio (A13Vx) is well-rounded and accommodates various needs.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-playing-overwatch-2-2.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The MSI Stealth 16 Studio supports PD (Power Delivery) charging, allowing faster charge speeds over USB-C without needing to use the default charger. The Thunderbolt 4 Type-C ports on the laptop support 100W PD Charging, with a charging rate of 20V@5A. This is convenient when you want to quickly charge or use the laptop plugged in, but want to use a smaller and more portable charger when on the go. It won't be able to sustain full workloads without depleting your battery. Still, provided you aren't doing GPU-intensive tasks for extended periods of time, it's great to have this charging option.</p><h2 id=mux-switch>MUX Switch</h2><p>The Stealth 16 also features a MUX switch which allows you to toggle between the dedicated GPU and integrated graphics manually, providing greater control over the laptop's performance and power consumption. Additionally, MUX setups typically deliver superior performance compared to laptops that route the GPU's output through the integrated graphics, as they allow the GPU's output to be routed directly to the panel.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-viewing-angles.jpg><p>This can be great high-performance hardware for demanding applications such as gaming and video editing while also offering the flexibility to switch to integrated graphics for more power-efficient use cases.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-webcam.jpg><h2 id=cooling>Cooling</h2><p>The MSI Stealth 16 Studio manages to strike a good balance between performance and portability. With a thickness of just under 20mm, it is hard to imagine it much thinner, given its powerful hardware. Nevertheless, it does not compromise on cooling with Cooler Boost 5, which allows the laptop to maintain excellent thermals even under heavy loads without any noticeable thermal throttling.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Cooler Boost 5 is a thermal solution designed by MSI that utilizes dual fans and several heat pipes to help dissipate heat generated by the laptop's components, such as the CPU and GPU. The Shared-Pipe design of the heat pipes allows for more efficient cooling, as heat is transferred from both the CPU and GPU to the cooling system.</p><p>This design helps improve the laptop's thermal capability under extreme loads, such as when gaming or performing demanding tasks. With Cooler Boost 5, the Stealth 16 Studio is able to maintain lower temperatures and higher performance during intensive tasks, ensuring a smooth and stable experience.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-security.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>When the laptop is flipped over, you can see that nearly half of its bottom panel is vented.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-next-to-razer-blade-17.jpg><p>In contrast, the Razer Blade 17 we recently reviewed, only has three significantly smaller vents for its fans. MSI's design, coupled with the raised feet, allows cool air to flow in from the bottom and exit through the fans located on the back, which are also directed toward the bottom of the screen. This cooling system is efficient and effective in keeping the laptop's internal temperature in check.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-benchmarked-devices.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>After extended periods of heavy use, the laptop can still get hot to the touch, especially above the function keys where the heat is being exhausted, as well as the right side of the trackpad. There is also a good amount of warmth near the WASD keys, so if you are gaming with the built-in keyboard, it's noticeable.</p><h2 id=display>Display</h2><p>Similar to many of MSI's other lineups, the Stealth 16 Studio features a 16:10 display, which MSI calls the "Golden aspect ratio". The display is available in two variants: a UHD+ (3840 x 2400) with a 120Hz refresh rate, or a QHD+ (2560 x 1600) with a 240Hz refresh rate. Both display choices offer 100% DCI-P3 (Typ.), IPS-level panel technology. The first is a 4K option best suited for creative work, while the second, with the higher refresh rate, is better for gaming. Our review model came with the QHD+ display, which we suspect most users will prefer.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-cinebench-r23.png><p>Bezels are thinnest on the display's sides, with a larger plastic bottom that features the MSI logo. MSI has added a slight lip to its top bezel, which houses its IR FHD webcam (30fps@1080p). This portion has a smooth plastic finish which contrasts nicely against the rest of the laptop's bezels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-puget-davinci-resolve-benchmark.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>With its 16:10 aspect ratio, a resolution of 2560 x 1600 pixels, and 240Hz refresh rate, this gives you plenty of screen real estate to work with, a high enough resolution to ensure images and text are crisp and crisp clear and is great for smooth gameplay. The display offers deep blacks and vibrant colors. Additionally, the display covers 100% of the DCI-P3 color gamut, making it ideal for color-sensitive work like video editing and color grading.</p><h2 id=webcam>Webcam</h2><p>While not necessarily impressive, the IR FHD webcam is above average for this category. It's not particularly sharp, nor does it have the best contrast. It handles low-light environments well and adjusts its exposure automatically when faces are detected. A physical shutter that can be manually closed for additional security is located above the webcam.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-puget-davinci-resolve.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=security-features>Security Features</h2><p>The MSI Stealth 16 Studio (A13Vx) laptop includes several security features that provide peace of mind for users. The laptop includes a fingerprint reader allowing users to authenticate their identity with a touch.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-puget-photoshop.png><p>Windows Hello is also a convenient and secure way to sign in to the laptop, using facial recognition or fingerprint authentication to access the system. This eliminates the need for passwords and can make it harder for unauthorized users to access the device. Unlike some of MSI's business laptops though, Tobii Aware is not supported on the 16 Studio.</p><h2 id=benchmarks>Benchmarks</h2><p>Compared to previous gen hardware, MSI says we can expect up to 30% faster performance for the CPU and up to a 50% boost in performance for the GPU.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-firestrike.png><p>These improvements will be particularly noticeable in demanding applications such as video editing, 3D rendering, and gaming, making the 2023 models of the MSI Stealth 16 Studio (A13Vx) an even more powerful and versatile choice for users who need better export times or higher FPS.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-timespy.png> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=cinebench-r23>Cinebench R23</h3><p>Cinebench R23 is a benchmark test that measures the performance of a computer's CPU using a multi-core rendering test and a single-core rendering test. The scores in the "Multi" column represent the performance of the CPU when using all available cores, while the scores in the "Single" column represent the performance of the CPU when using only one core. Overall, these scores give a general idea of how these laptops might perform in real-world scenarios requiring heavy or light CPU usage.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/msi-stealth-studio-16-atomic-heart.jpg><p>Based on these scores, we can see that the MSI Stealth 16 Studio has the highest multi-core performance, followed by the MSI Creator Z16P. This means these laptops are better suited for tasks requiring heavy CPU usage, such as video rendering, compiling code, or running virtual machines.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In terms of single-core performance, the MSI Stealth 16 Studio is again the top performer, followed by the MSI Creator Z16P. This indicates that these laptops are better suited for tasks primarily using a single core, such as web browsing, word processing, or other tasks that don't require heavy CPU usage.</p><p>Looking at the data, it is clear that when the MSI Stealth 16 Studio is unplugged, there is a significant decrease in its multi-core score. Specifically, the score drops from 19805 when plugged in, to 9633 when unplugged. This represents a decrease of around 51%, a very significant drop. It is worth noting that other laptops on the list also experience a substantial decrease in performance when unplugged, but the drop seen in the MSI Stealth 16 Studio is one of the worst offenders. For example, the MSI Creator Z16P sees a drop of around 42%, while the Razer Blade 17 (2022) sees a drop of about 28%.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>It is possible that the significant drop in performance when unplugged is due to the review unit being a pre-production unit.
