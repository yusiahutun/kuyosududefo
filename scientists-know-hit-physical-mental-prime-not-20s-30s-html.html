That's according to the most current research and thorough analysis from a wide range of influential economists, scientists, and psychologists.
It shows that the peak decade for performance in endurance sports like marathon running and sailing is in your forties.
But the average athlete in high-impact sports such as sprinting and football reach their prime at around 25."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Fast-twitch muscles rely on a type of energy production that does not require as much oxygen.

Those activities use slow-twitch muscle fibers which <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="noreferrer noopener" href=#>rely heavily on oxygen</a>&nbsp;to generate energy for continuous muscle contractions over a longer span of time.&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>And <a style=font-weight:700 class=class rel="nofollow noreferrer noopener" href=#>slow-twitch muscles can grow</a>, especially as a person keeps training in sports that rely on a more sustained form of energy.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>In a person’s later years creativity and innovation, characteristics that people often associate with youth, can reach their peaks.
