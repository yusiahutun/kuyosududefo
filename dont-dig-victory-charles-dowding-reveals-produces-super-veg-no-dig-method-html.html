One person who has been helping novice growers get to grips with their new-found passion for ‘grow your own’ – apart from Weekend columnist Monty Don, of course – is gardener Charles Dowding.
‘It’s been crazy,’ says Charles, 61, from his home near Castle Cary in Somerset, where he lives with his partner Steph Hafferty, a professional gardener and cookery writer."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There is lots of information on the backs of seed packets.</li><li>Five to ten minutes’ work in your garden every day is better than a longer period once a week.</li><li>When transplanting vegetable seedlings or small plants, they need to be planted deep enough that the stems are buried. This gives you stronger plants that are less likely to break.</li><li class=class>Invest in netting and mesh for protecting your vegetables from predators such as birds.</li></ul>&lt;!- - ad: https://mads.dailymail.co.uk/v8/us/femail/femailgardening/article/other/mpu_factbox.html?id=mpu_factbox_1 - -><span class=mol-ads-label-container><span class=mol-ads-label>Advertisement</span></span><p class=mol-para-with-font><span class=mol-style-italic>For more information on Charles’s courses and books, and more tips on No Dig, visit charlesdowding.co.uk.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJ6Voq6quI6gmKuclaO2r7OOmqmtoZOhsm6Ek25pb3BhZJGwutNmm6KfXau2pMDOq7Bme5iWv62x0mZ7qK%2BUnruoedGerZ6ZnKh6sb7OnaycnaNiwLa8xKtkr52XYruwecOinmallam1sLCNoaumpA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
