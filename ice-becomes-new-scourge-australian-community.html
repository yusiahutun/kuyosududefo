Similarly, the number of people seeking hospital treatment for amphetamine-related problems had almost doubled since 2001 from 145 per million to 272 per million in 2013.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While Australia is no stranger to the devastating impact of methamphetamine with a previous spike in the number of users in 1998, there has been a significant shift in the past few years, with the strength of the drug trapping a new generation of users.</p><h4 type=h4 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-1xqmoxd e793b7w0"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316"><a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Watch: Alleged drug smugglers cleared of charges in Hong Kong</span></a></strong></h4><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An estimated 1.3 million people in Australia - which has a total population of 24 million - have smoked, snorted or injected methamphetamine at least once, according to a report released earlier this year by the Australian Crime Commission.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">That report also said that 400,000 people had used meth within the last 12 months and that shipments from the mainland and Hong Kong made up a large percentage of seizures of the drug.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A national task force was set up in April to tackle what the then prime minster Tony Abbott labelled as an "epidemic" that was "beyond anything that we have seen before".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">While drug and addiction experts say the number of users is actually stable, users are now getting hooked on the stronger and more addictive version of meth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We're not in an epidemic but what looks like has happened is that existing users have switched from using speed to using Ice," said Nicole Lee, associate professor at the National Centre for Education and Training on Addiction at Flinders University in South Australia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"These are people using [Ice] fairly frequently, that is more than once a week, so it's a shift in severity, rather than numbers."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee said the latest figures show there has been a doubling in the number of people using Ice and a halving of people using speed. In previous years, less than 10 per cent used Ice weekly but that has increased to more than 15 per cent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee added that there had also been "a sizeable shift in the purity of the drug".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Speed and Ice are the same drug but Ice is a lot stronger. It's like the difference between light beer and a spirit. It's still alcohol but they're made in a different way and it's a different strength."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"So when you put all that together, we are seeing people using the drug more dangerously. They are using more potent forms and more frequently."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Those factors have created a perfect storm that causes greater damage to users and the community around them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The latest figures show that the number of methamphetamine-related deaths has jumped from 88 in 2010 to 170 in 2013.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee said the relapse rate for Ice users was about 80 per cent, compared to the average relapse rate of 50 per cent for alcohol and other drugs.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"It's because the huge release of dopamine damages those systems, and it takes about 12 to 18 months before they feel better."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Methamphetamine affects a person's dopamine system - which releases feel-good chemicals - but the drug also affects the noradrenaline system, which activates a person's "fight or flight" response.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"People on meth are on heightened threat alert all the time so things that might not trigger an angry response from you or me, might for them," she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee said anti-drug campaigns which depict Ice users as violent, emaciated drop-outs, paint a far from typical profile.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"In fact, the typical Ice user is between 20 to 29 years old, male, employed, and they are still engaged with their families and functioning perfectly."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Australia has the highest rate of methamphetamine use among developed nations, primarily due to its geography.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"If you compare us to the UK, Canada and the US, the rate of use in Australia is three or four times higher," Lee said, with cocaine ranked as a more popular drug in those other countries.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"That's mostly due to availability as we're far away from the cocaine markets but we're quite close to the methamphetamine manufacturing and now lots of it is made in Australia."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee said that it was unlikely that large numbers of people would start taking Ice, but there was still cause for concern.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"It's like if you had a room of non-smokers, and you put a packet of cigarettes in front of them, they aren't going to pick up smoking just because it's there - and that's the same for meth.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"But the fact that people are using more dangerously is definitely a problem, particularly for our health services," she said, "but it's still a relatively small proportion of our population".</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Lee said about 2.1 per cent of the population had used meth in the past 12 months, with about half of those trying Ice.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">About 70 per cent of people who have used methamphetamine in the last 12 months are employed.</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: Ice becomes the scourge of the Australian community</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0mifqKaXYriwusZoo5qvXZi%2FqrnEaJirrJmYuaZ7kHFub2xjZ3yqr8RmmZ6bn6KytHnNnq5mq5OkwrOzxGaYrqukp66ttcCnZJynnaLCr7XTsg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
