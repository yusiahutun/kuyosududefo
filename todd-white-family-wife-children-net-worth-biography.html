He grew up with a love for field hockey, as it is one of the most played sports in his country, Canada. When he was much younger, he played field hockey in the Central Canadian Hockey League for Kanata Valley Lasers. He played for Kanata Valley Lasers for two seasons, between 1991 and 1993, and in a single season, he set a record for the highest score of Kanata Valley Lasers.</p><p>While still in high school and playing for Kanata Valley Lasers, he also taught a hockey class. During one of his classes, the then assistant coach of the Clarkson University hockey team invited him to watch his team play. Shortly after his visit, White was recruited by the Clarkson Golden Knights, where he spent his next four years playing field hockey. During his time at Clarkson University, he received a scholarship to play field hockey and spent his four years at the university majoring in accounting and finance.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/Todd-White.jpg><p>As a recent Todd White played 33 games and scored 22 points, assisted 12 times, and scored 10 goals.

Things went badly for him at first when he was not included in the national draft in 1997. In the summer of 1997, however, his career took a good turn when he was signed on as a freelancer by the Chicago Blackhawks. In his last season with the Chicago Blackhawks, he played only one game before he was transferred to the Philadelphia Fliers on January 26, 2000.

White spent two seasons with the Wilds and then signed with the Atlanta Thrashers in the 2007-2008 season. His second season with the Thrashers was without a doubt the best season of his career.
