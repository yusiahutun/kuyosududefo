To that list we can add Hong Kong’s very own troubadour-turned-auteur Olivier Cong, who was paired in “The Wind with a Voice”, a left-field chamber concert staged by HKPhil on May 30, with Erkki-Sven Tüür, the Estonian composer whose early prog rock lineage doubtless inspired the intergenerational exchange."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Jonny Greenwood’s orchestral soundtracks and Bryce Dessner’s symphonic output immediately come to mind – two art rock guitarists in arena-filling bands (Radiohead and The National, respectively) who have both previously been programmed by the Hong Kong Philharmonic Orchestra.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To that list we can add Hong Kong’s very own troubadour-turned-auteur Olivier Cong, who was paired in “The Wind with a Voice”, a left-field chamber concert staged by HKPhil on May 30, with Erkki-Sven Tüür, the Estonian composer whose early prog rock lineage doubtless inspired the intergenerational exchange.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Tüür, perhaps best-known for leading the band In Spe from behind the Iron Curtain, will also see the Asian premiere of his Symphony no. 10, ÆRIS, for Four Horns and Orchestra performed by the full orchestra on June 2-3.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The programme of “The Wind with a Voice” ping-ponged between the two men’s works and was divided by somewhat incongruous home videos each composer filmed of their hometowns – Hong Kong’s city streets cast next to a snowy Baltic wilderness, an MTR ride juxtaposed with a beautiful Tallinn castle, glowing evening sun intercut with urban alienation.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/01/a4cab565-ad38-4082-b5f4-9e285ff39269_4f9d9cf0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If these cute clips were designed to highlight how far apart the composers’ worlds are, then the musical programme was tasked with closing that gap.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both men, for one, seemed particularly attuned to extra-musical cues.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Often first conceived visually in sketched form, Tüür’s early work draws from the contrasting shapes and tactile surfaces of buildings, in evidence here in the thrilling Architectonics VI (1992), where the instrumental families represent different “materials”: the unruly, atonally abstract woodwind section wrestles through growing fog clouds cast by the formal, modally melancholic strings (while the vibraphone, at times, attempts to keep score).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the 63-year-old’s surreal Fata Morgana (2002), the contrasts are sly and multifarious – the telepathic trio darts easily between startling changes in tempos and tonalities, before stopping with deliberation at every page turn.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A programmatic sense pervades: fleeting moments of inner musical coherence appear designed to conjure the sense of mirage implied in the title. The piano periodically lays familiar footsteps, sparking a sensation of déjà vu.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/01/d93a9efe-d767-4f5d-8173-67549576fcd8_7a5a1a1f.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cong’s aesthetic confrontations are more wrought, more on the nose – strafing the chasms between technology and tradition, organic and recorded sound, music and verse.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Most arresting was “The Response” from Cong’s 2020 album City of Strange, which he has described as a collection of “short stories about a dying city”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After a minute of apocalyptic string turmoil, Cong himself recited an eerie monologue from behind the synthesiser on stage, ending the with the couplet, “This is a city of strange, and I can never leave”.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2023/06/01/cd72859c-5119-4895-b23b-e3bbd43f3f26_229ae51b.jpg>The thirtysomething’s other three selections in the concert all came from his forthcoming third solo studio LP, Tropical Church. They included “Burning”, which opens with a short, solo pastoral lament for the traditional bamboo flute shakuhachi, played by Sunny Yeung. It is then cinematically recast over spidery strings and funereal drums, recalling Cong’s soundtrack to last year’s Hong Kong drama <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Lost Love</span></a>.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Inspired by synthesised voices, “Solace” saw melodramatically mournful strings cry out over thumped descending piano chords, which the artist appeared to sample on the spot, before conjuring a haunting electronic heartbeat.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The concert closer, “A Prayer of Mine”, offered an oblique elegy for the composer’s own “tropical church” (Hong Kong again, of course) over minor chords and samples of wildlife calls, which perhaps proved one spoken word moment too many.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">As the piece’s final notes rang out, the big screen sparked to life once more with an image of a snow-carpeted cabin that can only be Tüür’s home – suspicions confirmed when the visiting composer, seated two seats to my right, broke all the house rules to pull out his phone for a commemorative snap.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Erkki-Sven Tüür and Olivier Cong – The Wind with a Voice”, co-presented by the Hong Kong Philharmonic and West Kowloon Cultural District.
