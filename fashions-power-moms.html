I ask, genuinely perplexed, how she can look so put together with five children at home. "I thrive in chaos, let's start there," she smiles.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">To many, Beard looks like a typical working mother.

But for those of us watching on Instagram, Beard is redefining the idea of "having it all" for a digital generation with an all-or-nothing approach to motherhood that includes press parties and red carpet events, nights out with friends, after-school activities, and several family vacations per year—all while looking good doing it.</p><img alt="Text, Font, Thigh, Poster, Advertising, Lingerie, Undergarment, Publication, Swimwear, Undergarment, " title="Text, Font, Thigh, Poster, Advertising, Lingerie, Undergarment, Publication, Swimwear, Undergarment, " width=1200 height=2720 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/48/1480610720-hbz-111516-powermoms4.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"In order to survive, you've got to cut corners," reveals Beard, who, to achieve those immaculate curls, goes to bed with wet hair, prioritizing a morning makeup routine over blowouts. "I don't have time to sit at the salon, but I do have time for my face," she says. "My eyebrows and lips are very important to me. Everyone has one or two things that they need—get it done quickly and you feel like a million bucks."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Beard highlights her hair every six months to "camouflage grays," and admits that exercise is the only thing she has since given up. "Do I eat a ton? No. Do I feel like I'm in shape? Kind of," she says. Instead, Beard hikes on family vacations—the most recent being in <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/a17180/things-to-do-in-tibet/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Tibet class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Tibet</a>—and is "constantly on the go, either lifting a kid or a bag." Meanwhile, her Upper East Side apartment, which is "full of animals" including chinchillas, turtles and a dog, is immaculate. Does she ever sleep? "I love being awake," Beard admits, revealing that she gets her "best work" done after 11 p.m. but aims to sleep eight hours per night. "Every minute is accounted for," she adds.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">A DAY IN THE LIFE OF VERONICA MIELE BEARD</h2><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for HBZ Power Moms - Veronica Miele Beard" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/583f2daee694aa675d5150b8/thumb_1480535489.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Indeed, for <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.kirnazabete.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Kirna Zabete's" data-vars-ga-product-id=7521b53c-c7a1-4054-9086-bc094631fc78 data-vars-ga-link-treatment="(not set) | (not set)" data-href=http://www.kirnazabete.com/ data-product-url=http://www.kirnazabete.com/ data-affiliate=false data-affiliate-network data-vars-ga-product-price=$0.00 data-vars-ga-product-retailer-id=383b48b7-7b2d-4e95-b5e1-3c9ed0420b0e class="body-link product-links css-1gunp80 e1aq0z090">Kirna Zabete's</a> Beth Buccini, who first opened her upscale SoHo boutique in 1999 and divides her time between her sprawling 130-acre property on an old dairy farm in Pennsylvania and her office in Manhattan, raising four children while growing a retail empire is about being "psycho organized with time." Three days a week, Buccini wakes at 5 a.m. to make her 8 a.m. Tracy Anderson class in the city, arriving at work by 9:30 a.m. where she will stay until the early evening and either take the train home to see her children before they go to bed, or, if she has a work event or plans with friends, will stay the night at her New York City apartment. Twice a week Buccini works from home, driving the children (ages 13, 11, 9, and 7) to school before her work day starts. "Since we live in the middle of nowhere, there's no bus," she says, adding that she shares the driving duty with her real estate developer husband. "Whoever I didn't drop off that day I will pick up, so everyone gets a little face time with momma." To make sure no time is wasted, Buccini uses a color-coded calendar to keep track of her to-do list, which is laid out in small, bite-sized sections: "I will literally slot reading a document into the calendar so I know when I am going to do it and keep track of my time that way."</p><img alt="Text, Dress, Font, Romance, Love, Advertising, Gown, One-piece garment, " title="Text, Dress, Font, Romance, Love, Advertising, Gown, One-piece garment, " width=1200 height=2770 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/48/1480610778-hbz-111516-powermoms1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Buccini, whose vibrant Pennsylvania home was featured in the November issue of Harper's BAZAAR, credits her "inbox zero" philosophy and Apple watch for keeping her sanity. "Without fumbling for my phone I can see if it's the kids' school and can excuse myself right away," she says, adding that she loathes to let an email linger: "I only want to deal with an email once and deal with it at that time. It's a 'one touch' system." If she's "doing emails" all the time, she reasons, there won't be time for anything else.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 45-year-old, who opened two new stores this year—one in East Hampton and another nearby in Bryn Mawr—also "menu plans like a crazy person" on Sunday nights before ordering groceries online to ensure her family is eating a balanced diet. "I'll spread out my cookbooks and recipes I have pulled—I have binders full of recipes," she says. "It's just about being efficient and decisive with your time." Of course, having an extra pair of hands—or three—also helps. For Buccini, the most important career decision she made, she says, is who she married. "His support is the glue that keeps everything running smoothly," she says of her husband, with whom she just celebrated a 15th wedding anniversary. Buccini also has a nanny and a housekeeper, which, she says, is "super helpful in order to do everything I want to do, and run my life the way I want to where we live."</p><h2 data-node-id=21 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">A DAY IN THE LIFE OF BETH BUCCINI</h2><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for HBZ Power Moms - Beth Buccini 3" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/583f30cfbbddbd6c92cb7afb/thumb_1480536285.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Designer <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.lelarose.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lela Rose" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Lela Rose</a>, who gave birth to her two children after launching her namesake ready-to-wear label in 1998 and has since expanded with <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.lelarose.com/bridal/gowncollection data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Lela Rose Bridal" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Lela Rose Bridal</a>, agrees: "I'm not going to pretend—nannies, babysitters, whatever you want to call them—I rely on them a lot."

"Homework is one area I do not do, do not help with, do not get involved with," admits Rose, 48, adding that it's something she "hated" herself as a child.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=26 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I think that's going to horrify some mothers, but it keeps some real sanity between me and the kids," she says. "There's a lot of things about me as a mother that I know really work, and not being involved in homework works for us." Consequently, her nanny, who "totally gets it and can answer questions way better than I ever could," is in graduate school. Instead, Rose cooks with her children (aged 14 and 9) after work, before they "all sit down and have a meal together." They are adventurous eaters, she says, which makes dinnertime fun. "We're having Branzino tonight that I got at the greenmarket yesterday—my son loves fish eyes, he will eat the whole head!" And if Rose is entertaining, her children will join. "My kids are the cleaning crew so they sit down and they're part of the dinner party."</p><img alt="Human, Text, Carnivore, Fur, Toy, Natural material, Animal product, " title="Human, Text, Carnivore, Fur, Toy, Natural material, Animal product, " width=1200 height=2720 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/48/1480610843-hbz-111516-powermoms2.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=29 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Quick to dispel the fantasy of "having it all," Rose recognizes that her ability to delegate is a "real luxury." She explains: "I don't want to undersell that I have help—great help—and a great husband." Like Buccini, Rose insists that her emotionally supportive husband is imperative in the success of her business and family life, and maintains that she set the terms for childrearing early on. "When I was first pregnant, I was like, 'This is going to be 50/50—I change a diaper, you change a diaper.' And it has been fairly equal, which is great." For Rose, it's important not to get caught up in the "constant worry game" of working mothers versus non-working mothers, which, she says, can add unnecessary pressure to an already hectic life. "A lot of it is self-inflicted," she says. "The working mothers are always like, 'Oh goodness, the non-working moms are at school chatting with the teachers. What am I doing wrong? What am I not doing enough of?'" Instead, the designer puts emphasis on the "old fashioned" quality time she gets to spend with her children. "I'm really close with my kids, we have a great time because I'm not doing the stuff I don't want to do. We get to sit down at dinner, play Backgammon or Monopoly and laugh about what's happening and there's that lack of annoyance or frustration. It makes me a happier person and frankly, it makes my relationships much happier. For me, that's great bonding time."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=31 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rose also commends her "fabulous housekeeper" for giving her the ability to host dinner parties several times a week, whether it's for friends, family or a work event. "I am very picky about my food and she knows my tastes," says Rose, who grabs fresh groceries from the market on her way home from work and sends her housekeeper to the butcher and cheesemonger for specifics. "If I'm running home and have 12 extra people coming for dinner, I'll get her to chop the onions so I have stuff prepared," she reveals, adding that she also does prep work the night before. "My husband is watching TV and I am caramelizing onions and chopping. I'm definitely prepared in that area—that's one thing people don't understand, it doesn't just happen when you come home from work. You need to prepare, set things out and do things in advance; that's what makes it pleasurable because you're not frazzled." Still, Rose makes a point of not sweating the small stuff. "If something's burned, I don't mind saying, 'Pick up pizza on your way home.' That kind of thing doesn't ruffle my feathers, although I don't usually burn things," she laughs.</p><h2 data-node-id=33 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">A DAY IN THE LIFE OF LELA ROSE</h2><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for HBZ Power Moms - Lela Rose" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/583f2d34d5593042a6411edf/thumb_1480535366.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=36 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Similarly, Stacey Bendet's power mom philosophy revolves around a certain level of flexibility.

An example: "You try and set these rules and schedules, but then sometimes you just have to be like, 'You know what, you can have ice cream for breakfast!'" Yet—much like Buccini, Beard, and Rose—Bendet makes sure to manage her time in "a very specific way."</p><img alt="Head, Human, Text, Sunglasses, Font, Street fashion, Goggles, Poster, Family, " title="Head, Human, Text, Sunglasses, Font, Street fashion, Goggles, Poster, Family, " width=1200 height=2900 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/48/1480610907-hbz-111516-powermoms3.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=39 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Every morning the 36-year-old will wake at 4.30 a.m. to practice yoga before the kids are up so she is "calm and ready to be with them." She sets aside 15 minutes for herself to get ready ("the big trick is slick-backed hair, a clean face and a red lip," she says) before she makes breakfast and her eldest daughters (aged 7 and 5) hop on the school bus. Here, Bendet will usually stay to play with her 10-month-old for 30 minutes until it's time to walk to work—which allows her to "really think through" what she has scheduled for the day.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=41 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Bendet's nanny will also bring the baby to the Alice and Olivia office for an afternoon playdate, "so I get that special time with her," she says, adding: "I always try to have one-on-one time with each of the girls once a week, whether I take <a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/interiors-entertaining/a13419/what-christmas-is-like-at-the-white-house/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Eloise class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Eloise</a> for a mommy dinner or Scarlett shopping, I'm always trying to carve out solo time with them." Bendet is usually home from 5:30 p.m. to 8 p.m. for dinner, bath and bedtime, after which she will head out to dinner with her movie director husband, attend a function or pop by a fashion industry event. "I like to be home for bedtime and a hangout; that's important," she says. "Then I make time to be social." Weekends are then reserved for friends and family who come over on Sunday night for an early dinner cooked by Bendet's chef. "We'll always have a family-style meal where everyone is done by 8.30 p.m.," she says, adding that all the children will eat downstairs, the adults upstairs. "It's a really good way of keeping in touch with people you wouldn't see that often."</p><h2 data-node-id=43 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">A DAY IN THE LIFE OF STACEY BENDET</h2><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for HBZ Power Moms - Stacey Bendet" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/583f2d78e694aa6772e1e008/thumb_1480535431.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="Human, Hat, Text, Font, Fedora, Poster, Sun hat, Love, " title="Human, Hat, Text, Font, Fedora, Poster, Sun hat, Love, " width=1200 height=2740 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/48/1480630774-hbz-111516-powermoms5.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=47 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a data-tracking-id=recirc-text-link href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/culture/interiors-entertaining/advice/a817/veronica-swanson-beard-interview-1011/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Veronica Swanson Beard" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Veronica Swanson Beard</a>, the other half of label Veronica Beard, agrees. After the mother-of-three is done attending events during the week, she leaves weekends for "friends and family all mashed into one where everyone is together all the time" at their holiday house in Locust Valley, Long Island. Unlike her methodical sister-in-law, Swanson Beard is more of a "fly by the seat of my pants crazy doer" who doesn't stop moving to "keep all the balls in the air," which, she admits, "is really hard." Often, when she feels "really good" about being a wife or a mom, she feels she's not spending enough time at work. If she's "killing it" at work, she feels like she's not seeing her children enough: "That's the human condition for women, we have to be so much to so many people," she says, "whereas a lot of working dads don't feel the same pressure to be as involved at home." Her husband, however, is very "hands on"—an active part of what she calls a precarious balancing act. She is also "so grateful" for her nanny, who makes the children feel taken care of and loved.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=49 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The 37-year-old also counts having her sister-in-law, Miele Beard, next to her at work every day as "the luckiest thing in the world." The pair often rely on each other for emotional support with impromptu "therapy sessions" in their office. "We talk each other off the ledge every day," says Swanson Beard. "We come in and download, like, 'I need to talk to you about this, I need your opinion on this.'" They also anticipate one another's schedules: "I know when she needs an afternoon to take care of the kids and we cover for each other," she says, adding, "I couldn't imagine if this was just me, it would be crazy. Whenever we are asked, 'How do you all do it?' we are like, 'Well, there are two of us.' It doesn't matter what Veronica you're getting, as long as you're getting one of us!" she laughs.</p><h2 data-node-id=51 class="body-h4 css-3zjk8x emevuu60">A DAY IN THE LIFE OF VERONICA SWANSON BEARD</h2><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/play.db7c035.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=24 width=24 alt="Play Icon" role=img title=Play style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><img alt="preview for HBZ Power Moms - Veronica Swanson Beard" title="Video player poster image" width=2000 height=1000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/vidthumb/manual_upload/583f307ee694aa6763546d70/thumb_1480536199.png style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=54 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Still, surely something's gotta give? And where does "me time" fit into the equation? For Swanson Beard, it's scheduling time for yoga and tennis on the weekends as exercise, and prioritizing fresh manicures and hair highlights, which she'll book for 8 a.m., and dinner with her husband after the children are in bed. Consuming popular culture falls by the wayside. For Buccini, it's the same: "I'll watch TV when I'm 50," she says, adding that her respite from chaos is her train commute into the city, where she is able "to think" and "complete tasks" uninterrupted for a few hours. An avid equestrian, she also heads straight to the barn after dropping the kids to school when working from home for an hour of solitude. Meanwhile Rose, who admits to being "absolutely terrible" at keeping up with pop culture ("I watch zero TV, no Netflix, nothing"), loves to read; books are her private downtime before she goes to sleep. As far as keeping up with social media, Miele Beard doesn't "do" Facebook or Snapchat, preferring instead to watch documentaries and films with her children. And Bendet—though she often posts to Instagram herself—will rarely scroll through the app. "I participate more as an influencer and a designer, rather than looking at other people's pictures," she says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=56 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Ultimately, New York City itself also plays a big part in the power mom narrative, where Bendet acknowledges that being a mom in the city "is a lot easier" than if you live in the suburbs where: "You can't Seamless or Caviar food," she says, adding that the 24-hour nature of the city also helps her marriage, which she admits can be a struggle to maintain. "What really suffers the most when you have your own business and you have kids and these crazy travel schedules is your actual marriage, because it's hard to carve out that time for each other. We are lucky because we live down the street from restaurants like Nobu, so we can just ask our nanny to stay a little longer and walk over there for dinner together once the children are in bed," she says. For Miele Beard, it's a similar story: "That's why this city is so amazing, my big girls can babysit and my husband and I can go across the street and tell them to call if they need us. We can talk without the kids. That's really important."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=58 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Buccini concedes that her "very full life" may have her "in the weeds" at the moment, but she knows she will "never get these years back with the kids or with my career and I want both," she says. "I started this business because I said I want a career and I want it on my terms." Both she and her husband have become experts in juggling; and they agree that "getting <span data-redactor-tag=span data-verified=redactor id=docs-internal-guid-1165ec3f-b6a6-422d-eead-9c6de4667fd5>rid of the guilt" attached to their busy schedules is imperative. "Guilt does not help anybody. If something isn't working, I should feel no guilt about it; I should just come up with a solution to fix it," she explains, pausing. "You know, </span>I read an article once where Stella McCartney said as a busy working mother of four, she's just really decisive. I'm the same way—you just make the decision to keep pushing the ball uphill." Here, Buccini glances at her Apple watch and stands to hug me goodbye. My allotted calendar time slot is up.</p><img alt="Text, Font, Electric blue, Symbol, Graphics, Graphic design, Artwork, Emblem, " title="Text, Font, Electric blue, Symbol, Graphics, Graphic design, Artwork, Emblem, " width=1507 height=754 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/48/1480543933-hbz-112216-powermoms-popart.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/7bf2ab27-4111-4708-b50b-b42e9a01ff78_1562950403.jpg alt="Headshot of Olivia Fleming" title="Headshot of Olivia Fleming" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Olivia Fleming is the former Features Director at HarpersBAZAAR.com. Born in New Zealand, Olivia was raised with two basic beliefs: That deep respect for the earth is a given, and women are imperative to leading a successful, progressive country (two female prime ministers took office during her childhood). But after moving to New York in 2008, she quickly realized that her status quo was at odds with the rest of the world. In an effort to change that—and to legitimize women's duel interest in fashion, politics, and human rights—Olivia focuses on female storytelling. From long-form features and ambitious packages, to new podcast initiatives that elevate the magazine's content mix across platforms, she champions the stories no-one else is telling.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfmMKtwNSrnGielZbBtr7ErGaaaWllhnZ7xZqqoaGfo8BuvM6wnKtlnaS6tHs%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
