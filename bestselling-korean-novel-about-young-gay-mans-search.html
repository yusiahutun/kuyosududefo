In almost every novel or film about queer lives in the past 50 years, we are confronted with an exploration of loneliness – in particular, the loneliness felt by queer people who have never been accepted enough that the act of self-acceptance occurs without thought. Without this, the queer person’s road to romantic love is fraught at best."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Grove Press</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In almost every novel or film about queer lives in the past 50 years, we are confronted with an exploration of loneliness – in particular, the loneliness felt by queer people who have never been accepted enough that the act of self-acceptance occurs without thought. Without this, the queer person’s road to romantic love is fraught at best.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Affairs, often in excess, account for a never-ending search for substance, a search dotted with heartbreak and unfulfilment. And in a sprawling metropolitan city, being alone almost becomes an identity.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Such is true of the protagonist and narrator of Sang Young Park’s 2019 bestseller Love in the Big City, available now for the first time in English.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/30/5302ca94-c8e1-42d6-b9cf-5812606f6c84_fbdcf459.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Young is a gay Korean man living in Seoul whose life has not turned out the way he wanted it to. Whereas his close friend Jaehee is getting married, forsaking the frivolity of their college days and settling down into something that, for her, looks like stability, he is still chasing one-night stands and trying to find a job (in addition to being a writer) that he actually likes.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jaehee’s new life casts Young’s in an unsettling light: is it possible for him to find love as well, and does he actually want it? The answer, of course, is yes, but it is only he who seems unable to move on from the casual (and often tumultuous) relationships they both had while younger.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Park devotes the first part of the novel to the past, when Young and Jaehee are living together with no concerns other than what they will have for dinner and where they will party. They dart about the world in youthful aimlessness, a time when their lack of serious romantic attachments is never really a problem.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Not even Young’s ailing Christian mother, who has cancer, dents him enough to worry about being unhappy. But when he is forced to take care of her after Jaehee leaves, he must confront something more than the self-loathing that is the bedrock of his personality.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">This predicament leads him to his first substantial relationship, with a man (whose name we never learn) who is right and wrong for him. Older and handsome, he makes Young feel a sense of pride – until their differences prove irresolvable.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/12/30/4828103a-2b67-4eb8-aca2-38aaa0389ef8_b0afac62.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Who was he, and what was I to him?” Young eventually wonders, when he realises that the man is by no means out of the closet and deeply uncomfortable with the “disease of homosexuality”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">His next relationship is with the wonderful Gyu-ho, much closer to his age and different from Young primarily in that he is not from the big city (despite being somewhat of a country bumpkin, he is no less appealing to Young).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For the most part, their relationship is the stuff of dreams – the romantic utopia Young has always wanted. They eventually move in together, but this decision to cohabitate taxes them perhaps more than they can withstand.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Soon after, Gyu-ho finds a job in Shanghai and Young suffers the devastating loss of his departure. Gyu-ho is his true love but Young ultimately cannot have him.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Though this bleak conclusion could be the catalyst for serious reflection, Park’s treatment of it is too superficial to merit more than passing notice.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Next-gen Chinese science fiction writers celebrated in translation</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Anton Hur’s translation provides helpful access to the Korean context in which the book takes place, but Park renders Young’s voice too much like that of a petulant teenager – so much so that it is difficult to take Young seriously, even when he muses about heartache and isolation.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The novel also lacks meaningful shape, and, as a result, the events unfurl haphazardly and serious plot points emerge too heavy-handedly. The biographical elements from which Park borrows may well be fertile ground for fictional exploration, but they do not lead him towards a well-crafted story.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Instead, we are left with something like a high-school student’s diary: the issues Young confronts are real and important, but he is never provided the kind of insight and depth a more careful writer would have given him to lift this novel above its soap-operatic tone.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOm6aoo6NkrrPAyJyjnmdjZoNygZJrZpudo6nAprjLoqWgZZukv6atzWalqK6VoXqirs6uq2axn6q7qHnGmrBmpZGjwG6%2FxJqpnKA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
