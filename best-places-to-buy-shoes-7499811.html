Buying online alleviates anxiety from asking the sales assistant for yet another size and it allows you to see how the shoes will mesh with your clothes at home. Here’s the catch: To avoid scrolling fatigue, you need to know where and how to look.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Marina Chen, co-founder and director of operations at&nbsp;Vivaia, says she, says she partly relies on sites like InStyle (that is a direct quote, not a shameless plug) for online shopping recommendations, but she notes it’s important to understand your style ahead of any sole searching. “Trends exist to guide us and provide inspiration—they are not meant to completely change our style,” Chen says. Instead, she suggests considering versatility, comfort, and lifestyle before clicking “add to cart.”&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Reviewing each brand’s fit and size guides, considering special features such as arch support, anti-slip outsoles, and material quality, and reading reviews can also help you find your Cinderella fit. With that in mind, you can carry on to the fun part — shopping for hundreds of shoes from our favorite retailers.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-nordstrom-shoes></span><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Nordstrom Shoes</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Nordstrom style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ThX7DZclhC7Fr-el-PxapMmY0f0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Nordstrom-0e131d05e36f46689535e3ea7d02d30e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Nordstrom</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">At this point, we’ll need to design a “Thanks, they’re from Nordstrom,” bumper sticker to efficiently answer where we get my most complimented shoes. Its sale section is the secret to&nbsp; finding deals on a spunky Jeffery Campbell platform or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>celebrity-approved pair of Hokas</a>. The retailer also carries the same designers we see showing up at award shows <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>and snapped in paparazzi photos</a>, such as Vagabond, Totême, Sam Edelman, and Dolce Vita.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">But the benefits of shopping online at Nordstrom go beyond getting mistaken for an off-duty supermodel. One of my favorite aspects of the site is how it curates several looks for how to style the shoes below each product — the only downside is you may end up with an overly stacked online cart.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free standard shipping<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>All styles, free shipping, deals, size range<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>4-18 | <strong>Price Range:</strong> $-$$$$</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-dsw></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="New Balance 237 Sneaker - Women's" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NuoOtq1z5161Gj5piguE0uJb7CQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dsw-new-balance-237-sneaker---womens-d435f8de90164805b13761bdf8539850.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>DSW</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">DSW covers all your basics. We know it as an extremely reliable option when you need sensible work heels or a new pair of running shoes, but don’t dismiss it as a place only suitable for you to replace your beat-down <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>leather sneakers</a> every year.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Call it the fairy godmother of shoes, because DSW carries hundreds of brands to present you with whatever style you wish to purchase — whether that means <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>replicating a sought-after celeb look</a> with some <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">pink patent leather Mary Janes</a> or finding <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">the exact shoe</a> worn all over <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>the red carpet</a>. We look to the retailer to jump on a new trend as it has choices for nearly every price point. Plus, it’s hard to find another retailer who offers savings on high-end brands, like Salvatore Ferragamo and Off-White. Between free shipping and a free VIP club that gains you access to bonus deals, we’re tempted to make it our one-stop shop for anything south of our ankles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free standard shipping | <strong>Best for: </strong>Deals on your favorite brands | <strong>Size Range: </strong>Women's 4-12&nbsp; | <strong>Price Range:</strong> $-$$$</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-shopbop></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt=Shopbop style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/ZnX8-8Yxugix4Uj3lwNocsxlzBE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Shopbop-560ff371f6d84cf9be6907a27e839ac8.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Known among shopping experts as the site to score a fabulous deal, we caution you to tread lightly on ShopBop’s site as you might end up not only with multiple shoes in your cart but also a stuffed schedule of social plans to wear them.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The retailer currently offers almost 3,000 shoes from over 50 designers which you can filter by size, brand, shoe type, and color to streamline your search. While you can shop from familiar brands like Madewell, Superga, and Veja, we recommend having fun discovering a one-of-a-kind style like these dreamy disco <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cult Gaia kitten heels</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">spunky Schutz cowgirl boots</a> that are begging to be worn out.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Shipping Policy: </strong>Free Ground Shipping<strong> </strong>| <strong>Best for: </strong>Variety, trendy<strong> </strong>| <strong>Size Range: </strong>3-14<strong> </strong>| <strong>Price Range:</strong> $$-$$$$</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-zappos></span> <img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Zappos New Balance Women's 608 V5 Cross Trainer" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kLf0GAN6b_eodLN2zJexvpzVYW8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/new-balance-womens-608-v5-cross-trainer-26c73ac4d8804af8be038f6eea0a1877.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zappos</p></span><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Like DSW, Zappos offers impressive discounts on brands like Doc Martens, Birkenstock, Free People, or any footwear TikTok deems is the “It Shoe” of the upcoming season.

There’s a pair of &nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Steve Madden Lasso Boots</a> waiting for you.

However, if who is wearing the sustainable shoes (think: <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Katie Holmes</a> and Gigi Hadid) is any indication as to whether we can expect to continue seeing styles, we feel the hits will keep coming.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In true Ref fashion, the footwear flawlessly merges trendy and timeless: Styles include metallic sandals with classic designs that will long <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>outlast the trend</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">ageless strappy heels</a>, and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">sexy knee-high boots</a>.
