Great to see you! I always feel a little nostalgic at the end of the year.</p><p>So I thought we could look back on everything we’ve done over the last twelve months.</p><p>For starters, you’ve been putting that Daily Adventure Incense to great use… You’ve encountered Zorua and been caught up in Ditto&amp;#x27;s shenanigans…</p><p>And that’s just the beginning! Doesn’t remembering your accomplishments get you energized for more?</p><p>It does for me, and maybe Pokemon are feeling energized by the season too – look how many are out there today!</p><p>I wonder if Pokemon perceive time like we do? Hmm… This could be a good topic for next year’s World Pokemon Ecological Society conference.</p><p>As for you, you should go for a stroll and think about all the amazing things you’ve done, %PLAYERNAME%!</p><p>Seeing all of them gets me thinking – remember how lucky we were to meet so many Pokemon first discovered in the Alola region?</p><p>We even encountered all of the island guardians! I’d never seen them in person before – had you?</p><p>It just goes to show that the more time we spend exploring the world, the more exciting sights we’ll see.</p><p>What’s that? “Even if that sight’s on the other side of an Ultra Wormhole?”</p><p>Ha ha! Very true, even if the experience was a little stressful. But I think it was worth it in the end, especially since we made a new friend – Rhi!</p><p>Speaking of which, why don’t you pay Rhi a visit? In the meantime, please let me take a closer look at some of those Pokemon you’ve caught.</p><p>Seasonal greetings, %PLAYERNAME%!</p><p>Is this appropriate to say? I have only learned of “seasons” after coming to this world.</p><p>You have been busy today. What has occupied your attention</p><p>Reminiscing with Professor Willow? I am told that is a fitting activity for this time of the…day?</p><p>No–year. I apologize. Tracking time by the sun’s passage is new to me, although I do find it fascinating.</p><p>I can confidently say that a world as vibrant and radiant as yours is quite rare.</p><p>As rare as making a friend as kind as you, %PLAYERNAME%. Your aid has been invaluable, both in acclimating me to this world and in containing the Ultra Beasts.</p><p>Our time together has been well-spent, from my perspective. If you are amenable, I would enjoy continuing our collaboration. Are you free right now?</p><p>I would like to observe as you catch some Pokemon. Your accuracy is remarkable, and I suspect I could learn something watching you.</p><p>That’s another day of research done. Thank you for choosing to spend it with me – and with Pokemon!</p><p>This year has had its challenges, as they all do. But no matter what obstacles we face, I know I can rely on you to help overcome them…and that thought always brightens my day.</p><p>I hope that the time you’ve spent with me and with Pokemon has also been a source of joy, because you yourself bring joy to so many.</p><p>In fact, if I could make a wish right now, it’d be for our next year to be just as amazing as this one. And with you around, hey – I’m sure it will be. See you again soon, %PLAYERNAME%!”</p><p>The December 2022 Community Day runs on Saturday, December 17, 2022, and Sunday, December 18, 2022, from 2:00 p.m. to 5:00 p.m. local time.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7p8HTrqmen5GisrOxy56YrJ2jY7CwuY5rZ2tqX2Z%2FcLDEnJymmpWneqS7zKasp6GkrnqlrdhmaWlqYmLAsbHCopilZaKawKat0ZyfZqmlmsC1edOaqqSrXaeyuK3RnapmnZ6YvLa6056prGc%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
