UPDATE 3/3/20 3:35 p.m.:
A rep for Doug Hutchison responded to TooFab regarding Courtney Stodden's Instagram post, where she claimed,&#34;I've been scared to even speak up about feeling groomed or being verbally abused during the almost 10 year marriage because I was a child and he was 50 when we married but I'm a woman now and it's time for me to put my big girl pants on and speak on this matter."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"It's not right -- even if the parent signs off."</strong></p><p><strong>UPDATE 3/3/20 3:35 p.m.:</strong></p><p>A rep for Doug Hutchison responded to TooFab regarding Courtney Stodden's Instagram post, where she claimed,"I've been scared to even speak up about feeling groomed or being verbally abused during the almost 10 year marriage because I was a child and he was 50 when we married but I'm a woman now and it's time for me to put my big girl pants on and speak on this matter."</p><p>"FYI, Courtney should probably get the length of her marriage correct, (six years not ten)," Hutchison's rep wrote to us in response. "I guess this is all coming as a retaliatory effort for Doug finally coming clean about Courtney faking a pregnancy and miscarriage for money and promotional benefit amongst other things that went on during their marriage."</p><p>The rep went on to add: "If it helps, I would suggest you conduct an internet search where you will find, as recently as 6 months ago, Courtney speaks publicly and on many occasions, glowingly about her relationship with Doug, and in fact on more than one occasion, publicly stating that she still loved him and wanted to reconcile their marriage."</p><p>To read more about the actor's claims that his ex faked a pregnancy and miscarriage you can read our previous article <a href=#><strong>here</strong></a>.</p><p><strong>Original Story Below 3/3/20 2:14 p.m.:</strong></p><p><a href=#><strong>Courtney Stodden</strong></a> marked the finalization of her divorce from <a href=#><strong>Doug Hutchison</strong></a> on Tuesday with an emotional and revealing message.</p><p>Taking to her Instagram account, the model/singer posted a throwback snap of the couple, who had an on-again/off-again relationship for nearly a decade, beginning with a courtship when she was 16 and he was 50.</p><p>"It's an emotional day for me," the now 25-year-old began. "God only knows how he's feeling, but I can tell you that it's for the better. I look back at this picture and feel absolutely taken advantage of."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>Courtney and Doug began their love affair when she signed up for one of his online acting workshops in 2010. Never having met in person, the two fell for each other after months of courtship over the internet. They eventually married in Las Vegas in 2011.</p><p>"I've been scared to even speak up about feeling groomed or being verbally abused during the almost 10 year marriage because I was a child and he was 50 when we married but I'm a woman now and it's time for me to put my big girl pants on and speak on this matter," she wrote.</p><p>She went on to say how the experience was devastating and she had no one to turn to when her life became "a lonely and dark place."</p><p>"I've felt completely trapped, manipulated and at times abandoned by adults // growing up in such an environment," Courtney continued.</p><p>In 2013, they announced they were ending their marriage, only to reconcile a year later. Back in March of 2018, Courtney filed for divorce. The "Freak Alert" songstress called out Doug, saying she will "always love" him, but will "always be angry."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9c5b2fc7-97d7-58f0-b79c-ed39bb3c5ca3 data-container-ref=toofab:article:fcbfc360-4d0b-5441-9e9e-e173b272c20a data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/47/5by4/2020/02/11/47629b1b4a635bb489f5986e70ae9b59_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Doug Hutchison Claims Ex Courtney Stodden Faked Pregnancy and Miscarriage For Money</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"You've left me — a child woman, feeling belittled and confused. These things I shall overcome. I wish you well," she wrote.</p><p>The lengthy posting ended on a plea to Doug, including a reference to her parents, who allowed the pair to date and marry, despite her being underage and their 34-year age difference.</p><p>"But please don't ever do this to another minor again," she begged. "It's not right -- even if the parent signs off. Wait a respectable amount of time before marrying. Children aren't on your level. I'll always love you regardless. Be better.
