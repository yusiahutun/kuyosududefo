Even though Tina has been practicing&nbsp;Buddhism for several years now, she chose to have an American wedding and claims that she has finally reached a stage in her life that she<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener"> calls</a> her "Nirvana." She exclaimed,</p><p>"It's that happiness that people talk about, when you wish for nothing, when you can finally take a deep breath and say, 'Everything is good,'" she said. "It's a wonderful place to be.</p><p>The guests who made it to the wedding ware grand like the wedding itself.
