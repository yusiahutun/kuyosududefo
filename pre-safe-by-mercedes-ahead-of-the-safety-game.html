You may also want to inquire about the "Automatic Valet System". If you're interested, you can read our article about <a href=#>Bosch-Mercedes Automatic Valet System</a> for more information.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Now let's dive in to know more about the functionality of Pre-Safe.</p><h2 id=understanding-the-functionality-of-mercedes-pre-safe>Understanding the Functionality of Mercedes Pre-Safe</h2><p>Pre-Safe is a feature that utilizes a network of sensors to detect potential crash situations. When it detects irregularities such as swerving or skidding, it immediately responds with a series of measures to enhance passenger protection. These automatic reactions work together to reduce and prevent further injuries from an accident. So, let's learn more about Pre-Safe.</p><p>If you're curious, there are more <a href=#>automated vehicle safety technologies</a> to read about.</p><h2 id=pre-safe-brake>Pre-Safe Brake</h2><p>The Pre-Safe Brake feature uses radar sensors to detect stopped or slowing traffic ahead and automatically initiates up to 40% braking power if an imminent collision is detected.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The driver is alerted and the Pre-Safe system is engaged. If the driver brakes, full braking pressure is applied. If the driver does not respond, the system can apply full braking on its own to reduce the collision's intensity.</p><p>It is also <a href=#>known as Automatic Emergency Braking</a> (AEB).</p><h2 id=pre-safe-plus>Pre-Safe Plus</h2><p>The Pre-Safe Plus feature helps prevent or reduce the severity of rear-end collisions. The car's rear radar detects potential collisions. If a collision is imminent, the system will flash the rear hazard warning lights. This warns the driver behind to slow down or stop. The system also activates the reversible belt tensioners. This holds the occupants in place.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The system also moves the seat backrests to an upright position. This protects the occupants in the event of a collision. If the vehicle is stationary, the system will increase the braking force. This holds the car as securely as possible to prevent or lessen a secondary crash with the vehicle ahead.</p><h2 id=pre-safe-impulse-side>Pre-Safe Impulse Side</h2><p>Pre-Safe Impulse Side is a collision avoidance system that uses radar to detect an imminent side impact. It takes action by inflating an air chamber on the seat, pushing the front seat passenger towards the middle of the vehicle, and increasing the distance between them and the door. This reduces the impact force and the severity of injuries.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The system uses radar data from both the front and side of the vehicle to detect a potential collision and act on it quickly and effectively, providing an added layer of protection for the occupants.</p><h2 id=pre-safe-sound>Pre-Safe Sound</h2><p>Pre-Safe Sound protects a vehicle's occupants from hearing damage in the event of a collision. When the system detects that a collision is unavoidable, it activates the vehicle's sound system and plays a "pink noise" at 80 decibels.</p><p>This noise triggers the stapedius reflex, which causes the stapedius muscle to contract, weakening the connection between the eardrum and the inner ear for a split second. This helps to reduce the damage that loud noises from a crash can cause to your hearing.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Pink noise is usually a viable option for those interested in trying it. However, Dr. Michelle Drerup from Cleveland Clinic acknowledges that individuals who have hearing loss or are sound sensitive may find pink noise irritating.</p><p>If you wish to gain a practical understanding of pink noise, watch the video below.</p><h2></h2><h2 id=drive-safely-and-responsibly>Drive Safely and Responsibly</h2><p>Pre-Safe by Mercedes is a revolutionary safety system that detects potential crash situations and automatically responds with measures to enhance passenger protection. Each of the safety features—Pre-Safe Brake, Pre-Safe Plus, Pre-Safe Impulse Side, and Pre-Safe Sound—reduce the chances of injury or death in the event of a collision.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Overall, the Pre-Safe system provides an added layer of protection for the occupants and gives peace of mind while driving. However, it's important to remember that the ultimate responsibility for safety on the road lies with the driver. It's always important to drive safely and responsibly.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGinq51dqK6nsYybsGallaewprDErGSaoJWWsW67xWaroZ1dqK6nsdOyZKCZnZp8</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
