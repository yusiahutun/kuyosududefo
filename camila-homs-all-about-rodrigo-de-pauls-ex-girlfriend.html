All About Rodrigo De Pauls Ex-Girlfriend</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-02-13</div><p><strong>Camila Homs is well-known as the ex-girlfriend of Rodrigo De Paul, a soccer player for Atletico Madrid. Homs is the eldest of two sisters, as well as the daughter of Liliana and Horacio Homs.</strong></p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_worth_of_Camila_Homs>What is the Net worth of Camila Homs?</span></h2><p>Her net worth has not yet been disclosed, but we know the net worth of the father of her two children, who has amassed a substantial fortune through his great football career. As of January 2023, Rodrigo De Paul’s estimated net worth is <strong>$10 million.</strong></p><h3><span id=Rodrigo_was_15_years_old_when_they_first_met>Rodrigo was 15 years old when they first met</span></h3><p>Homs, who attended the San Martin de Tours women’s school, met Paul, who was 17 and playing in Racing’s lower divisions when she was 15 years old.</p><p>Homs accompanied him on his voyage around the world. They have two beautiful children as a result of their union. Their older daughter Francesca was born in January 2019 and their son Bautista in July 2021. They remained wed until 2021.</p><p>She was upset and concerned after her separation from Paul.</p><p>Following her divorce from Paul, Homs expressed disappointment and sadness in an interview, stating that she had a project in mind and may have explored reconciliation. Despite this, she could no longer continue.</p><p>She also stated that she has invested heavily in the family and has always been faithful, but she no longer wishes to remain with them if they fail to reciprocate her loyalty.</p><h2><span id=Her_conduct_toward_her_ex-partner_nearly_lost_him_in_the_World_Cup>Her conduct toward her ex-partner nearly lost him in the World Cup</span></h2><p>Following their separation, Homs filed a lawsuit against Paul for child support and monetary compensation, putting Paul at risk of missing the 2022 World Cup in Qatar.</p><p>She stated that she had no intention of ruining her ex’s profession, but that as a mother, it is her duty to fight for her children’s future.</p><p>Camila also expressed optimism that an agreement can be reached soon. She continued by saying that he is very enthusiastic about the World Cup.</p><p>She acknowledged that she respects and adores him because he is the father of her children. Paul debuted with Argentina in 2018 and has been a mainstay since.</p><p>Paul and Homs eventually reached an agreement, but Homs subsequently sued Paul for failing to pay the required charges.</p><h2><span id=What_did_her_former_partner_think_of_her_current_partner>What did her former partner think of her current partner?</span></h2><p>Paul revealed in a recent interview that he and Homs parted ways amicably and that their friendship remains strong. Then he discussed their video conversation.</p><p>He stated that he had a video conference with his daughter during which he and Tini spoke with his daughter and Homs. Homs was there on the video call with their daughter, so as their daughter paraded, he and Tini clapped and focused on her.</p><p>He continued by stating that it is extremely obvious and very natural. His relationship with Tini and Cami, he said, is very clear, and they get along great.</p><p>Cami knows she can rely on him if she needs anything, and he knows she can rely on him as well. He does not want baseless rumors to cause problems in their relationship or the raising of their children.</p><p>Paul went on to say that when he ended his relationship with Homs, he met Tini, and the two eventually fell in love. He added that Homs is currently rebuilding her life with her new lover.</p><p>He described Homs’ spouse as a lovely, child-loving man who celebrated Bautista’s birthday. Due to Pre-Season, Rodrigo was unable to attend his son’s birthday celebration.</p><p>However, he informed his family that he was there and that there would be no issues because they know how he is with his children.</p><p><span data-sheets-value='{"1":2,"2":"Also Read: Is Deadliest Catch&#39;s Josh Harris Wed?
