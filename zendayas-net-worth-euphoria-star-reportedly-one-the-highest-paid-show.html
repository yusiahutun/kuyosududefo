The actress is currently rocking fans’ world on “Euphoria,” but this is one of her fantastic acting achievements that comes alongside a growing bag of wealth. Here’s what the superstar is worth so far.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Zendayas_Early_Career></span>Zendaya’s Early Career<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zendaya, in her young teenage years,&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">started her career as a model and dancer,</a>&nbsp;with most of her income coming from commercials. By 2010, she bagged her first T.V. role as Rocky Blue in “Shake It Up.”&nbsp;</p><p>The youngster starred alongside Bella Thorne on the show for three years. After that, she starred in other Disney TV installations like “K.C. Undercover,” “Zapped,” and “A.N.T. Farm.” By 2018, the star who was gradually entering her coming-of-age years said goodbye to the Disney franchises.&nbsp;</p><p>She got her entertainment transition on “Dancing With The Stars” season 16 and came out second place. Since 2019, the star actress has been exploring Hollywood as a grown adult, and her resume keeps getting better.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Zendaya.jpg><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Inside_Some_Of_Zendayas_Roles_Since_2019></span>Inside Some Of Zendaya’s Roles Since 2019<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The singer has been playing Rue Bennett on “Euphoria” since 2019, and it is safe to say that her status as an actress has witnessed tremendous change since then.</p><p>Zendaya’s “Euphoria” character is a young drug addict who could not be saved through rehab. Rue tries to get by every day through the show’s plot while dragging along the addiction as it eats deep.&nbsp;</p><p>Fans saw their favorite child star go through some transformation for this role, and she has seen some rewards. In 2020, she&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">bagged</a>&nbsp;an Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress In A Drama Series for “Euphoria.”</p><p>She has since starred in movies including “Dune,” “Zapped,” “Malcolm And Marie,” and “The Greatest Showman.” Zendaya also bagged a groundbreaking role in the MCU franchise, “<a href=#>Spider-Man.</a>“</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=What_Is_Zendayas_Net_Worth></span>What Is Zendaya’s Net Worth?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Zendaya’s salaries as an actress and model have seen her make more money in recent years. One thing to note is that her music career has been on hold for a while, but it seems she is ready to explore again.&nbsp;</p><p>For now, Zendaya’s goldmine is squarely in the big and small screens. The actress’s salary in “Euphoria” is unknown, but she is said to be one of the stars&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">earning the most,</a>&nbsp;compared to supporting actors like Jacob Elordi.&nbsp;</p><p>The 25-year-old played Chani in “Dune” alongside fellow star Timothee Chalamet, and it was a minor role. According to estimates, Zendaya earned $300,000 in the movie. Presently the second installation of Dune is in the works, and Zendaya’s character will reportedly take center stage.&nbsp;</p><p>The award-winning actress’s income boosted following her&nbsp;role in “Spider-Man: Home Coming,”&nbsp;where she played Michelle MJ Jones, Peter Parker’s girlfriend. “Homecoming” grossed over $880 million in the box office, and there is no doubt that Zendaya’s check was fat.</p><p>However, the estimate of her income from the other two Spider-Man franchises lies between $2 to $4 million. As of 2022, Zendaya’s net worth <a href=#>sums</a> up to $15 million.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-instagram wp-block-embed-instagram"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Her_Attitude_To_Money></span>Her Attitude To Money<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Despite making money way back in her preteen years, Zendaya’s attitude to money has always been about caution. This became a part of her so much that she even&nbsp;<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">became </a>anxious about spending money.&nbsp;</p><p>Zendaya grew up the daughter of a woman who takes calculated and careful steps regarding finances. However, the entertainer has shared that her dad is the opposite. This makes her in between being a spender and a frugal person.</p><p>Above all, the star has it at the back of her mind that if she did not work, all she has might be gone in a flash. For this reason, she is pretty detailed about the business part of her career.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kx6a6w5qwmqtdo7K1edaoqa2gXZrCsbTOq6CaZaOprrN50Z6nqKqkmrGtxYyopZ5lpJ2ybrTIoJ%2Beq6RivaK1w2aqoaenZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
