Are you in a panic about what to buy your friends and loved ones? Fear not: if they are a trail runner, there is no doubt they love gear and trail running paraphernalia.
Being a trail runner is as much about looking like a trail runner as it is about actually running on trails. So, they will love you for getting them the latest piece of apparel or a book for them to put in their house, so that visitors will ask, unprompted, “Oh, you’re a trail runner?"><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Are you in a panic about what to buy your friends and loved ones? Fear not: if they are a trail runner, there is no doubt they love gear and trail running paraphernalia.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Being a trail runner is as much about looking like a trail runner as it is about actually running on trails. So, they will love you for getting them the latest piece of apparel or a book for them to put in their house, so that visitors will ask, unprompted, “Oh, you’re a trail runner?”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Here are a few ideas to get you started.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Running backpack (around HK$400/US$50)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Trail runners need to carry a lot of gear, such as food and water, because of the relative isolation of their sport’s locations. If they are entering a race, they may even be required to carry things like jackets and medical supplies.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Normal backpacks don’t cut it, because they jiggle around on the runner’s back. It is difficult to find a balance between a lightweight pack, one that is big enough and one that does not bounce around.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If you want to gift your friend a running pack, check out the Salomon running vests or the Hoka One One running backpacks.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Coffee table running books (HK$200/US$25)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A nice big coffee table book full of wonderful pictures is a thoughtful and inspiring gift. Your running friend will flick through it, longing to escape to the trails, planning their next adventure.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There are countless and varied books to chose from, such as Lonely Planet’s Epic Runs of the World, Running Beyond by renowned photographer Ian Corless or the Wanderlust series with pictures of mountains from around the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">What’s more, your friend can leave the book out so that guests will ask questions about trail running – the questions your friend so longs to discuss without seeming like they brought up trail running … again.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If you think your friend would prefer more of a narrative, there have been some great releases in 2022 for new running stories.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Shoes (HK$1,000/US$130)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Runners go through shoes at a rate of knots. Especially trail and ultra runners. The rough terrain smooths the soles and wears out the shoe quickly. If your running friend doesn’t need a new pair of shoes now, they will in a matter of weeks.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And how convenient for them to have a brand new pair ready and waiting for them.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Bear in mind, shoes are a very personal thing for runners. They will tell you that the brand they wear is the best and all other brands cause knee pain.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So, take a sneak peak at a photo, or their shoe rack if you have access, and make sure you get the right thing.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Maybe they opt for big sponge like Hoka shoes have, or perhaps they prefer a minimalist Innov8 or Vibram, or the very popular S-lab by Salomon?</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Energy gels (HK$100/US$13)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The only thing trail runners consume quicker than shoes is gels. They guzzle them like a tank guzzles diesel.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">These energy gels keep them awake while they run and run and run. It is a pain to constantly be swinging by your running store to restock.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So a welcome gift, that is thoughtful and genuinely helpful but won’t break the bank, is a big box of running gels.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2022/12/08/bb8199d0-ca87-4cc6-9b99-3fbecaca19b2_f9f724ef.jpg><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Race entry and crew duties (range of costs)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Runners love to run, obviously. But the cost of entry to races is climbing. The market is crowded, and each race has to offer a point of difference or a high standard of checkpoint buffet to attract runners.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Race entry can cost up to HK$1,000/US$120, sometimes more. This limits the amount of races a runner can take on. Why not subtly ask what race they would love to run in 2023 and buy them an entry?</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Make it an even more thoughtful gift by offering to crew them at the race, so the gift becomes a shared and cherished experience. (Crewing is a lot of effort and time commitment, so be sure you know what you are signing up for before you offer!)</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">Poles (HK$800/US$100)</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Running poles are becoming increasingly sophisticated. They weigh almost nothing, fold up and slip in your backpack, to be whipped out and assembled as quickly as Legolass draws an arrow to load his bow – in fact, some even come with a quiver to store the poles.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Increased sophistication can mean increased cost, too, so maybe your running friend has been putting off buying a set. Check out Black Diamond poles, Salomon poles and even Decathlon poles.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kwLG70a1mqK2kmbywvo6tqZqhnGK%2FtrrNoqWgZ5Gnwaqvy55mbGpgZ4F5gI6cn6uho6m6or%2BMa2dral2ctqfAjKKbnpmjYsGzrcilZKutnqOys7%2BMrJ%2BonaNir6KvyqmYnKOjYrSmuNI%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
