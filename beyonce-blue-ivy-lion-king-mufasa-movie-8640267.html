On Monday, April 29, Disney confirmed that the mother-daughter duo will be starring in a new movie together by <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>releasing a trailer for an upcoming live-action Lion King prequel</a>. Mufasa, which will be an origin story for Simba’s dad, a.k.a. the original king of the Pride Lands, will see Queen Bey reprise her role as Nala while Blue Ivy will play her daughter, Kiara. Donald Glover will also be returning as Simba in film, which is set before 2019's live-action Lion King.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The decision to have Beyoncé’s real-life daughter star opposite her in the film seems like a no-brainer, especially since Blue Ivy held her own while performing alongside her mom on her latest tour and was featured on "Brown Skin Girl" off her Lion King: The Gift album.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The 12-year-old dancer also memorably joined Bey for a Renaissance Tour performance of “My Power" from the same album, making this collaboration seem like a full circle moment.&nbsp;Considering Lion King's musical reputation and the fact that Lin-Manuel Miranda was tapped to write new music for the movie, it's likely that Blue will also be singing, potentially alongside her mom.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The director of Mufasa, Moonlight’s Barry Jenkins, told <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Entertainment Weekly</a> that he wanted to cast Blue Ivy after seeing her work in a short film called Hair Love, but he was originally unsure about broaching the idea of the mom-daughter team working together.&nbsp;</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“I was like, 'Is it worth a shot? Would Blue Ivy want to do it? Would Beyoncé want to act opposite her daughter? Is it too close to home?'" he told the publication. Luckily, "once we put the question to them, they both responded with enthusiasm."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He also revealed that Mufasa, which will also star Aaron Pierre as Mufasa and Kelvin Harrison Jr. as a young Scar, was filmed before Beyoncé and Blue Ivy teamed up on the Renaissance Tour, meaning it was one of their first times working together professionally.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He told the publication, “I think Blue really grew up over the course of that tour, so the Blue Ivy you see in this film, it's like a time capsule, this very, very, very young stage of her life, and she got to share it with her mom.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Judging from how well the pair meshed together on the Renaissance Tour, it looks like fans are in for a musical treat when Mufasa comes out on Dec. 20.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6wqKaTmnqjuNSeZKKuqWK5qrvNZqKippdiuraywKyYZqWfq7ameZdva2lqZmw%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
