Zach was a contestant on <a href=# rel=noopener>The Bachelorette season 19</a> with <a href=# rel=noopener>Gabby Windey</a> and <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachel Recchia</a>, where he was Rachel’s contestant and self-eliminated in the final three. Zach was announced as the season 27 Bachelor at the The Bachelorette season 19 “After the Final Rose” special in September 2022. “There’s no words, I’m just taking this in right now. I’m obviously really nervous right now but this is once in a lifetime,” Zach said at the time. “I want to find my best friend, fall in love with my best friend and really walk away with someone for the rest of my life.”</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Outlander.jpg><p>In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">People</a> in January 2023, Zach called <a href=# rel=noopener>The Bachelor</a> season 27 the “most emotional” season Bachelor Nation has ever seen.&nbsp;“It might not be the most dramatic season, but it’s the most emotional season that they’ve ever had,” he said. “But that’s not to say that this season will not have some drama. There’s no shortage of drama.” He continued, “Fans are going to see my full personality because I wear it on my sleeve. With last season, that necessarily wasn’t the case. I think I’m going to surprise some people with who I am.”</p><p>Zach also responded to criticism over ABC’s choice of him as the season 27 <a href=# rel=noopener>Bachelor</a> in an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in January 2023. “I would tell the critics and the fans, if you wanna watch something or this show and actually see love and no bullshit and not a scene or not an act, then I think you’re really gonna love this [season],” he said. “If you are someone that wants the unnecessary dumb drama — alright, [but] I might not be your guy. Plain and simple.” He continued, “I know what I want out of this, and I know what it takes to have that healthy relationship.”</p><p>Zach also claimed to <a href=# rel=noopener>The Hollywood Reporter</a> at the time that fans will be “pleasantly surprised” by his season. “Fans are going to be pleasantly surprised because right now, probably the No. 1 concern is, ‘OK, it’s this boring Bachelor, and there’s going to be no drama,'” he said. “The reality is, if you are someone that likes the show because you want people to find true love and an actual focus on what it’s supposed to be about — not about acting, not about this and that — then I think fans are gonna love it. If you’re into the unnecessary drama and stuff that’s just like ridiculous and doesn’t make sense, then yeah, maybe I’m not the guy for you.” He continued, “But I think what I’m really excited for is everyone to see the personalities of everyone involved because that was not necessarily something included in The Bachelorette. People don’t know necessarily who I am, and on this season, you’re going to see all of me. It’s the good, the bad, the goofy — the side that hasn’t really been shown before.”</p><p>But back to The Bachelor 2023 spoilers. So who does Zach choose as his winner on The Bachelor season 27?

It wasn’t bad, but it was unplanned and it had a significant impact on the production of the show.” Reality Steve continued, “For example, Gabi got the first 1-on-1 date in London, and then whatever this thing is that happened, basically ended all other dates in London. There was no group date, nor was there another 1-on-1. So Gabi is the only one who has a date of the 11 women that go to London.”</p><p>Reality Steve confirmed in a later post that the twist affected the rest of Zach’s season. “Whatever it is that happens in London and sets the tone for the rest of the season, that’s apparently the reason why trying to figure out who gets sent home in Estonia & Budapest is off,” Reality Steve wrote. “It’s nothing like someone leaves and returns. I was told it WASN’T that. But that it’s something the show hasn’t dealt with before and didn’t see coming.”</p><h2>The Bachelor 2023 spoiler: Brooklyn is the second villain</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/Zach-Final-Three-The-Bachelor-2023.png><p>Brooklyn Willie, a 25-year-old from Mineola, Texas, was the second villain on The Bachelor season 27 after the first villain, Christina Mandrell, a 26-year-old content creator from Hendersonville, Tennessee, was eliminated.

The Bachelor season 27 winner is Kaity biggar, who is engaged to Zach, according to Reality Steve. Reality Steve confirmed in November 2022 that Zach’s final three were Gabi Elnicki, a 25-year-old from Pittsford, Vermont; Ariel Frenkel, a 28-year-old from New York City, New York; and Kaity Biggar, a 27-year-old from Kingston, Ontario. Reality Steve confirmed in February 2023 that Ariel was eliminated in the final three, and Zach chose Kaity s his winner and proposed to her at the The Bachelor season 27 finale in Krabi, Thailand. A <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Reddit</a> user also posted a photo in March 2023 of Zach and Kaity at the Final Rose Ceremony, which showed them kissing and Kaity holding Zach’s final rose.</p><p>Before The Bachelor season 27 finale, Zach hinted that he and Kaity are still together when he posted an Instagram Story in March 2023 of Terry Black’s BBQ in Austin, Texas, where he and Kaity both live. (Kaity is from Kingston, Ontario, Canada but works as an ER travel nurse in Austin; while Zach is from Anaheim Hills, California, but works as a tech executive in Austin.) In an interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Axios Austin</a> before The Bachelor season 27 premiered,&nbsp;Kaity named Terry’s Black’s BBQ as one of her favorite restaurants in Austin. “I love Aba, Launderette, Red Ash and Terry Black’s BBQ!” she told Axios Austin. Kaity also name Terry’s Black BBQ as one of her favorite Austin BBQ places in an interview with the “Click Bait” podcast in 2023.</p><p>For Zach’s engagement, it’s almost certain the ring was designed by Neil Lane, a celebrity jeweler, who has created engagement rings for The Bachelor, The Bachelorette and Bachelor in Paradise since 2008. In a 2016 interview with <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Weekly</a>, former host Chris Harrison revealed that Bachelor Nation couples have to stay together for a certain amount of time, otherwise they have to return the free engagement ring to Neil Lane. “There’s some rule, after a certain number of years, you get to keep it anyway,” he said. “But after months… it goes back.”</p><p>Lane told <a href=# rel=noopener>StyleCaster</a> in 2016 that he doesn’t know where the rings go, but that he designs them with the hope that the couple to stays together. “I make rings hoping that people stay together forever, but after they get the ring, I don’t have a say in it, and what happens after that, I don’t know,” he said. “Where the ring goes, I have to say, I don’t really know. I just say it goes to ring heaven.”</p><p>Before The Bachelor season 27 finale, there were rumors that Zach ended up with a contestant other than Kaity. Spoiler Instagram account @<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">BachelorWhatever</a> reported in November 2022, that Zach chose Gabi, his runner-up, as his winner. “I have received enough confirmation from sources and I finally feel confident to share Zach is engaged to Gabriella,” @BachelorWhatever wrote in an <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Instagram post</a> at the time. Reality Steve, however, denied that claim and maintained that Kaity is Zach’s Bachelor winner. “I’m well aware that an Instagram account posted two months ago that Zach was engaged to Gabi. Here’s what I can tell you: I trust my sources just like I assume they trust their sources. It’s now up to you the public to decide who you choose to believe,” Reality Steve wrote. “Personally, I’ll bet on myself. Nothing I can say is going to sway you one way or another. I don’t reveal my sources or how I get any info. But with another spoiler out there for 2 months that’s opposite of mine, now we can officially say one of us is dead wrong. Gonna make for a great finale night I tell ya’”</p><p>The “<a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Chicks in the Office</a>” podcast also claimed before the finale in March 2023 that Zach broke up with Kaity after The Bachelor season 27 finale and got back together with Jess, who was eliminated in ninth place. “I have no idea if this is true. I don’t at all. It’s just something I’ve heard that apparently no one else has has heard,” the podcast hosts said. “I don’t know how I heard it, but no one else did. So take that as you will, but apparently, after Zach got engaged to one of the girls, who I believe to be Kaity, that engagement ended and he’s now with Jess. Jess is the one who loves Taylor Swift. she loves body glitter. She even posted a clip recently of them at the ‘Women Tell All’ together. I don’t know how true this is. Do what you will with that information. I’ve left it all in your hands now. It’ll be crazy. It’ll be freaking crazy if it happens. Once again, I do not know if it is true.”</p><p>Who is The Bachelor 2023 winner, Kaity Biggar?

But after poking around a little bit, asking around, what I can tell you is: I don’t know who the Bachelor’s going to be, but you can cross Nate off the list. I have heard it is not him,” Reality Steve said. “I usually can’t get any details to stuff like that. I have heard, I have no idea if it’s true or not, but I have heard he rejected it, he doesn’t want to do it.” A source also told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">E! News</a> in August 2022 that Nate was the frontrunner to become the next Bachelor.</p><p>The reports also came after Nate was photographed holding hands with a woman at a grocery store in Chicago, Illinois, in August 2022, weeks after he cried over his breakup with Gabby on The Bachelorette season 19 “Men Tell All” special. “Spotted Nate and another girl in Chicago today,” an anonymous source sent to the Instagram account @bachelorettewindmill <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">along with a photo</a>. “They were both holding hands so could be dating?”</p><p>While Nate wasn’t the Bachelor 2023, Gabby told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Entertainment Tonight</a> in August 2022 that he was her number-one choice as the next lead. “Nate. 100 percent Nate, Nate, Nate!” she said. “He knows how to treat women. He’s so smart, he’s old, he has a great job, he spends his time reading—not reading social media, reading actual books. He has a daughter, so he knows what it’s like to have responsibility. He’s a real, true definition of a man.” Host Jesse Palmer also voted for Nate.&nbsp;“Nate is a standup guy. He’s an amazing person. He’s mature, he has an incredible emotional maturity, he’s vulnerable, he respects women, and he’s a great dad,” Jesse said. “I there’s there’s very few negative things I can say about Nate.” Jesse also had another choice for the next lead. “Are we still saying Pete Davidson? Is that still a choice?” Jesse said. “… I wanna ride that train. Wanna talk about a wild Bachelor season? That would probably be it. We might have to change some of our parameters.”</p><p>Gabby and Rachel also voiced their support for two Bachelors like how there were two Bachelorettes on season 19. “We loved each other for it, and loved having one another by one another’s side,” Gabby said of her relationship with Rachel. “I don’t know if men would feel the same, it depends on their relationship, but I think there’s a lot of good to come out of our season.” Rachel added, “I think ultimately if the Bachelors supported each other and loved each other to the extent that Gabby and I do, it could be incredible as well, but they would definitely have to be on the same level as us.

The Bachelor season 27 host is Jesse Palmer, who was the season 5 Bachelor in 2004 and was the youngest Bachelor in Bachelor Nation history at 24 years old. Jesse hosted his first Bachelor franchise show in 2022 with The Bachelor season 26 with Clayton Echard. During The Bachelor season 5 finale, Jesse gave his Final Rose to Jessica Bowlin, but didn’t propose to her. Jesse and Jessica continued to date, but ended their relationship a few weeks after the finale of their Bachelor season aired. In June 2020, Jesse and his girlfriend, Emely Fardo, married in an intimate wedding in New York City. Jesse told <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Us Weekly</a> in November 2021 that he and Emely planned to marry in Provence, France, before the current health crisis cancelled their wedding date. “We had originally planned a wedding in Provence, France, for summer 2020, which was postponed until summer of 2021 due to the pandemic, but we didn’t want to wait any longer,” he said at the time. “So, we had a small, private and intimate ceremony with close friends who lived in New York City.”</p><p>Jesse graduated from the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he played football for the Florida Gators, in 2001 with a bachelor’s of arts degree in political science and a bachelor’s of science degree in marketing. After graduation, Jesse was drafted by the National Football League to play for the New York Giants. He played with the team for four seasons from 2001 to 2005 as a quarterback. After the New York Giants, Jesse was drafted by the Canadian Football League to play for the Montreal Alouettes. He played with the team until 2005 when he was signed by the San Francisco 49ers. He then resigned with the Montreal Alouettes in 2006 before he retired from football in 2007 to pursue a broadcasting career. Since his broadcasting career started, Jesse has worked with networks like Fox, NFL Network, ESPN, ABC and SEC Network. He’s also guest starred on Law & Order: Special Victims Unit and made guest appearances on shows like Recipe to Riches and Good Morning America, and hosted the Food Network’s Spring Baking Championship and Holiday Baking Championship.</p><p>Jesse was announced as The Bachelor season 26 host in September 2021. “For more than 20 years, The Bachelor has brought the world dozens of unforgettable love stories, including at one time, my own,” he said at the time. “Falling in love is one of life’s greatest gifts, and I am humbled by the opportunity to return to the show as host this season to offer the newest Bachelor advice gained from firsthand experience and I am grateful to play a small part in his journey.” The announcement came after Chris Harrison, the former host of Bachelor Nation, confirmed in June 2021 that he had retired as the franchise’s host after 19 years. “I’ve had a truly incredible run as host of The Bachelor franchise and now I’m excited to start a new chapter,” he wrote in an Instagram post at the time. “I’m so grateful to Bachelor Nation for all of the memories we’ve made together. While my two-decade journey is wrapping up, the friendships I’ve made will last a lifetime.”</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Deadline</a> reported at the time that Chris received a mid-range, eight-figure settlement as part of exit plan with ABC, the network that airs the Bachelor franchise, and Warner Bros. Television, the company that produces the Bachelor shows. The magazine also reported that Harrison’s settlement included a nondisclosure agreement. Chris’ decision to retire as Bachelor Nation’s host came after he was slammed for&nbsp;his response to season 25 Bachelor contestant <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachael Kirkconnell’s racism</a> scandal in February 2021. <a href=# rel=noopener>Rachael</a>, the <a href=# rel=noopener>winner of Matt James’ season</a>, faced backlash at the time when photos resurfaced of her at an Old South Antebellum-themed party at Georgia College in 2018. Before the pictures went viral, Rachael was already under controversy after her former high school classmate accused her on TikTok of bullying her and other students for dating Black men. Other TikTok users then exposed Rachael for liking social media photos of her friends in culturally insensitive costumes and with Confederate flags.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Chris came under controversy</a> after he was interviewed about the scandal by season 13 Bachelorette Rachel Lindsay on Extra. During the interview, Chris asked fans to give Rachael “grace” and explained that he didn’t find the Antebellum party photos offensive because they just looked like pictures a college student takes at a party. Harrison also questioned whether the photos would be considered racially insensitive in 2018 when they were taken.
