“He wasn’t fully baked, so that was very scary in the beginning,” the 32-year-old actress told People of Billy, 1. “He was very, very small … fragile, little. Every time [he] fell asleep, you’re like, ‘Please wake up.’ [We were] constantly checking to make sure he was still breathing."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Every time [he] fell asleep, you’re like, ‘Please wake up.’ [We were] constantly checking to make sure he was still breathing.”</p><p>“It all started when [Caitlin] had contractions, [but then] we went to the doctor and he said, ‘It’s not ready, why don’t you go home and have a glass of wine?’” the 55-year-old actor explained. “She normally doesn’t drink, and hadn’t drank for nine months … she had one glass of wine and she was hammered.”</p><p>“It was really funny. I get to the hospital and I said, ‘I already had a glass of wine, now it’s a party!’ Then they gave me the epidural and I was laughing all over the place,” Caitlin added.</p><p>The pair’s first child together ended up arriving to the world six weeks early. Today, though, he’s a very healthy boy. The <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Full House</a> alum now reveals that parenthood is quite simple to him. “I waited a long time for a kid. I just had to meet the right person to do it with, and to straighten my life out. I was always meant to be a father, I think,” he said.</p><p>“He’s a natural. He would joke around about how he was never going to change a diaper, but he’s pretty good at it!” Caitlin said. “He’s such a happy, giggly guy. Fake sneezes make him laugh. But not real sneezes. Real sneezes kind of freak him out.”</p><p>The couple have always been very open about the <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">joys of parenthood</a>. “I’ve waited a long time. I’m 72 years old now so … It’s just the perfect time,” John joked during his appearance on <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Busy Tonight</a> last November. “I’m glad I waited so I could, you know, devote my total self to my wife and to my child, and forget about myself because you get tired of your own self after a while … How do you keep them alive by the way?”</p><p>We’re just happy to hear the couple’s baby is healthy now and bringing them both smiles!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46jpqGmXajBornOrGSwoZaaeqStyK2joqZdorCpwcahZKynnmKvqrjLsmSpqpWirrXB0Z5km6GiqbVw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
