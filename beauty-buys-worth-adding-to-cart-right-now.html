If being addicted to beauty products is wrong, we don't ever want to be right. There's something about finding the perfect berry-stained lip color, or a cleanser that doesn't leave our skin as dry as sandpaper, that can truly make our lives just a bit more joyful."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

There's something about finding <a href=#>the perfect berry-stained lip color</a>, or <a href=#>a cleanser that doesn't leave our skin as dry as sandpaper</a>, that can truly make our lives just a bit more joyful. These days, we'll take what we can get, even if it comes in the form of <a href=#>a concealer that hides our imperfections</a>. Sometimes it's the little things, you know?</p><p>From luscious skincare treats at <a href=#>The Detox Market</a> to the latest and greatest from <a href=#>Fenty Beauty</a>, these are the beauty products that have captured our attention this week. If you've been in a beauty-related pandemic-based rut, this list might just help you break out of it.</p><p>Herbivore has a ton of great skincare products, but their newest offering is <a href=#>this cleanser that's pH balanced and formulated without sulfates and synthetics</a>. It's low-foaming and non-stripping, but still has the oomph you need to remove waterproof makeup. And through the end of 2020, $1 from every bottle sold will be donated to <a href=#>Black Lives Matter</a>. Transform your skin with <a href=#>the Pink Cloud Rosewater + Tremella Creamy Jelly Cleanser at Herbivore for $24</a>.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e5/4by3/2020/07/15/e54020b04577440fb39298696cc359b5_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Herbivore</span><p>Founded by a makeup artist who battled major health issues due to toxic chemicals and heavy metals found in makeup, RMS Beauty has since become an award-winning fan favorite for its clean, simple, effective formulas. The crown jewel of the RMS empire? <a href=#>This concealer that's lightweight and hydrating</a>, and works with every kind of skin type. Available in 16 shades, you can effectively hide your flaws with <a href=#>RMS Beauty's "Un" Cover-Up at Credo Beauty for $36</a>.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/df/4by3/2020/07/15/dfdaf753ff2b4fb39dc20ccc6a9e6f70_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Credo</span><p>The right eye cream can mean all the difference between looking like you slept eight hours when you only slept two, or looking like you didn't sleep at all when you actually logged a solid 12. <a href=#>This fast-absorbing eye balm is on the job</a>, de-puffing and brightening with ingredients such as bakuchiol (a.k.a. plant-based retinol) and vitamin C. It also blurs the appearance of fine lines and preps your skin for makeup. Look bright-eyed and bushy-tailed with <a href=#>Alpyn Beauty's PlantGenius Line-Filling Eye Balm at The Detox Market for $62</a>.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2b/4by3/2020/07/15/2bfa72b3274a4103894442ba0686d15f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">The Detox Market</span><p>You know that look your lips get when you drink too much red wine? No? Just us? Okay, well, imagine how your lips would look with the perfect berry stain without an impending hangover. <a href=#>This dual-action lip balm nourishes with hemp-derived cannabis seed oil</a>, and leaves behind a sheer hint of color that says, "I tried, but not that hard, and I still look stunning." It also comes in five other colors. Make your lips even more kissable with <a href=#>Milk Makeup's KUSH Lip Balm at Sephora for $16</a>.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/63/4by3/2020/07/15/632d62183ae04d738ecc63d03e7ebab3_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Sephora</span><p>Rihanna didn't break the Internet when <a href=#>she dropped this cream blush on the beauty community</a>, but she damn near came close. The formula is lightweight, non-greasy, sweat-proof and melts into your skin, helping you avoid the clowny look that most cream blushes will impart. You won't experience that here: rather, you'll be flushed with a natural-looking fresh wash of color. Glow on in one of ten colors with <a href=#>the Cheeks Out Freestyle Cream Blush at Fenty Beauty for $20</a>.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/4b/4by3/2020/07/15/4b29695628c84a548ccced8f27ebef28_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit image-block__media-credit">Fenty Beauty</span> <a id=gallery-link-71210694-1206-4f9a-8d2f-1bbfabd807ea class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:71210694-1206-4f9a-8d2f-1bbfabd807ea data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:09dddc87-017d-4017-9a66-04338b68b874 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8d/4by3/2020/07/15/8da96d1d27714f5c9a2c15e6f88df72f_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">ABC</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3F7j3Bmam5fl7KiwdOyZJutqah6uLvRrZ9mmZSZtq%2BzjK2mZpuRp8Fuvsign61lnqTEcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
