The Traitors&nbsp;UK is a reality show based on the party game Mafia where 22 contestants play as “Faithfuls” who try to make it until the end to share the prize money of $250,000.</p><p>Host Alan Cumming picks out a set of “Traitors” whose goal is to eliminate all of the “Faithfuls” so that they could steal the money at the end. “Traitors” can murder “Faithfuls” and the rest of the “Faithfuls” must choose who they think killed the “Faithful” and banish them. At the end of each day, they all come together to vote for <a href=#>who they think killed them</a>. A “Faithful” can also go into the armory and gain immunity which allows them to be saved and not killed. At the end of the series, the remaining “Faithfuls” can share the prize money if there are no “Traitors” among them. However, if there is one “Traitor” remaining, then the “Traitor” wins the money for themselves.</p><p>“They asked me, who was not an obvious choice, and I got to sort of develop this new character. Although <a href=#>I’m hosting a reality show</a>, I feel like I’m definitely acting a character,” Cummings told Gold Derby. “I think it’s so much more fun. You get to wear those cloaks. You get to camp around. It’s the most camp show. It’s the campest thing I’ve ever done — and that’s me saying that.”</p><p>He continued: “I do feel that the show has connected with people in a way,” he readily admits. “With this show, so many people were so excited about it … It’s had this great connection in a really extraordinary way. The Emmys are obviously voted on by our working peers and by the people who work in our industry, and that’s always a really nice thing to be sort of lauded by people who you work alongside.”</p><p>Season 1 brought the champion out of Survivor and Big Brother legend Cirie Fields and time will only tell on <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://stylecaster.com/entertainment/tv-movies/1645668/how-to-watch-the-traitors-canada-in-us/>who will win</a> the $250,000 prize.
