Third-party accounts can act as de facto voices for some brands – @newbottega for Bottega Veneta, for example, because creative director Mathieu Blazy has chosen not to have an official Instagram account as part of the label’s marketing strategy.These are some of the fashion accounts that we think are worth following:

It was a true Cinderella moment.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Qin posted after the show: “Before the age of 70, I only cared about my patients as a doctor.

Now he is a fashion show regular, sitting in the front row, from where he updates his followers on venues, first looks and notable happenings.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The tone he maintains is consistently positive and upbeat, and often he celebrates behind-the-scenes figures in the industry. For example, Jonathan Ros, the PR director at communications agency Lucien Pagès, gets a call-out on his birthday.</p>Although he rarely shows photos or videos of the events he describes – for “<a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Pharrell</span></a> attending the Dior show right now” you will have to look elsewhere for photographic proof – Gvishiani’s content is increasingly valued as an industry news source for its peppy headlines.<h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">‘Fashion was freedom’: Yoox Net-a-Porter boss on London and her dream job</span></p></a></h3><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1">@checkthetag</h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">If you want to know which celebrity is wearing what right away, chances are Check The Tag will have all the answers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The account was started in 2016 by Brazilian sisters Kathleen and Wenny Miozzo, based in Rio de Janeiro, who worked as translators.
