They can work for either day or night depending on the styling and there are countless silhouette options for you to choose from at any given time. So, to help you make sense of all the different styles, I’ve broken down the <a href=#>seven types of black dresses</a> that are essential to have in your rotation.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/09/anua-cleansing-oil-tiktok.png> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Outlander.jpg><p class=p1>Wear a black dress, and you can pretty much go anywhere. That said, not all little black <a href=# id=auto-tag_dresses data-tag=dresses>dresses</a> are created equal. Some are better for trendy seasonal flings and others are timeless pieces worth investing in. Brands like Dress The Population and STAUD both design pieces that will run you a little more money, while affordable stand-bys like ASOS and <a href=# id=auto-tag_target data-tag=target>Target</a> offer options priced below the $50 dollar mark. This all goes to say that you don’t need to spend money to find a dress that works for you but if you do want to splurge, the options are most certainly there for you to check out.</p><p class=p1>While&nbsp;I&nbsp;personally believe that you should have one of every dress on this list hanging in your closet, feel free to pick and choose your favorite silhouettes.&nbsp;If you know that <a href=#>slip dresses</a> work for you, nab a few of those! But, if flared dresses are more your style, don’t be afraid to <a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>shop</a> a few in different lengths.</p><p class=p1>In any case, read on to shop all of the cutest LBDs on the market right now.</p><p class=p1><i>Our mission at STYLECASTER is to bring style to the people, and we only feature products we think you’ll love as much as we do.

You can pretty much do whatever you want with <a href=#>a black slip dress</a>, so spend some time in your closet and pull out some oft-neglected accessories and just see if your fave frock suddenly makes them work.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-17-at-1.30.42-PM.png><h2>Satin Cami Maxi Slip Dress</h2><p>If you thought that slip dresses had to be expensive in order to be cute, think again! <a href=# rel=nofollow>This option</a> from ASOS Design retails for only $45 bucks, so your cost-per-wear is well worth it.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/slip-dress-plus-.jpeg><h2 class=product-title>Long Gown</h2><p>This high-shine <a href=# rel=nofollow>Long Gown</a> from CHARLENE is too good to pass up on right now.

A dress this cute calls for equally fun accessories and a red lip, no questions asked.</p><p>A classic black dress becomes instantly more glamorous when covered in intricate lace.&nbsp;Though the move with most other LBDs is to go all out with accessories, with a piece like this, you’ll want to keep things simple. Opt for neutral, understated shoes and jewelry, and instead, keep the focus on the texture.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/Screen-Shot-2021-08-17-at-1.35.53-PM.png><h2>Nicole Dress</h2><p>This <a href=# rel=nofollow>Nicole Dress</a> from Dress The Population feels so sexy thanks to the sweetheart neckline and fitted silhouette.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/lace-dress-plus-.png><h2 class=mar-product-title>Open-Back Bodycon Lace Dress</h2><p>This long-sleeved <a href=# rel=nofollow>lacy&nbsp;dress</a> from Lane Bryant features a cut-out detail at the back for bonus fashion points.

Since a well-fitting black gown dress is so sleek and simple, you can accessorize at your leisure—which is great, because different events demand different vibes, ya know?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/08/gown-straight.jpeg><h2 class=product-details__heading data-gtm-vis-has-fired-10140090_276=1>Ruby Satin Charmeuse Dress</h2><p>How pretty is the draped halter neck on this <a href=# rel=nofollow>gown from BHLDN</a>?
