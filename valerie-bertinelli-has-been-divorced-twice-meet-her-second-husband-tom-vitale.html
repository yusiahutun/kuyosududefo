The star, who began writing in 2020, weeks after Halen lost his battle with cancer also described him as her soulmate. Of her second husband and their subsequent split, she <a href=#>wrote</a>:</p><p><strong>“We have drifted from the interests that made us a couple and found that those differences can’t be fixed. He is a good man who is going through many of the same issues that I have faced.”</strong></p><p>The TV personality further described their divorce as a slow painful one. She went on to clarify that their split had nothing to do with her first husband, Halen, as their marital woes began five years prior.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Tom_Vitale></span><strong>Who Is Tom Vitale?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Tom-Vitale-Biography-Net-Worth-2021-Age-Height-Weight-Wiki-1.jpeg><p><a href=#>Tom Vitale</a>, best known as the second husband of renowned actress and TV host Valerie Bertinelli.

Per a Dailymail article published in July, he <a href=#>reportedly</a> works at a post office, earning $16 per hour amid his then-ongoing legal battle with Bertinelli over post-divirce settlements.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Tom_Vitales_Marriage_To_Valerie_Bertinelli></span><strong>Tom Vitale’s Marriage To Valerie Bertinelli</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Valerie Bertinelli met her <a href=#>second husband</a> in 2004, after the TV host’s brother Patrick introduced them. At the time, neither was looking to gear off a relationship, as they each just experienced painful breakups.</p><p>Somehow, the electricity sparked between them, and before long, the two began dating. After seven years of dating, the twosome tied the knot in a surprise ceremony on January 1, 2011.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/20221102_114749.jpg><p>Sadly, their romance lasted for barely a decade before they were granted a legal separation in November 2021. Six months later, Bertinelli officially filed for divorce, on May 16, 2022, citing irreconcilable differences.</p><p>Although Valerie Bertinelli and Tom Vitale had no children together, the duo had kids from their previous relationships. The financial planner has two children, Addie Vitale and Angela Vitale, while the TV host has a son, wolfgang Van Halen, from her marriage to late rocker Edsie Van Halen.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=The_Post-Divorce_Drama></span><strong>The Post-Divorce Drama</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Although Valerie Bertinelli had good things to say about her ex-husband amid their divorce proceedings, things took an unexpected turn after the split.</p><p>Barely a month after the filing, Vitale asked to be awarded $50,000 per month in spousal support and $200,000 in legal fees according to the records.</p><p>He claimed their premarital agreement had a “waiver of temporary and permanent spousal support.” The financial planner also challenged their prenuptial agreement.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Valerie-Bertinelli-selling-items-from-2011-wedding-to-ex-husband-Tom-Vitale-1-1024x768.jpeg><p>After their legal issues dragged on for months, the two eventually reached a post-divorce settlement before a private judge Thank Goldberg. The terms catered for the Spousal Support and Attorney Fees issue. The bifurcated Validity of Premarital Agreement proceeding was also resolved during the private proceeding.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Valerie_Bertinelli_Dating_Now></span><strong>Who Is Valerie Bertinelli Dating Now?</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>As of October 2022, Valerie Bertinelli does not seem to be dating anyone. In a June 2022 appearance with TV host Koda Kotb on “Today,” the 62-year-old admitted she was done looking for love, and would be happy spending the rest of her life alone.</p><p>Going further, she <a href=#>revealed</a> her divorce from Vitale, and the resulting legal fracas left her with trust issues. She admittedly doesn’t see herself trusting anyone ever again, making it unlikely that she would seek out a new partner or let herself love again.</p><p>While the future has little or no dating prospects for Valerie Bertinelli, the TV chef has an impressive romantic history. Her exes comprise big names in the industry like late singer and guitarist <a href=#>Eddie Van Halen</a> and <a href=#>director Steven Spielberg</a> among others.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51kw6K4xKugnmWSmr%2B1tc2eo6WhXZ2utHnBnpynZZSew7C%2Bwp6bZqynnrCmecyenK1lmJq%2Fbr%2FEnKannF2dwrSuwKebZqyfonq3tdOao55n</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
