I loved the artwork and especially the guide to grief speak and particularly the description of ugly crying. Out of compassion we sometimes run for the tissues when we are faced with someone who is ugly crying. Maybe we should just wait a bit, don’t be so quick to give a tissue, because when we give a tissue, the message may be stop crying.”</p><p id=ePNilsdNAdkRC data-wc=37>“This book is for all who will live our lives and experience expected and unexpected losses.
