Who are his family members? What does he do for a living?</p><p>Learn more about him as this article proceeds.</p><h3><strong>Queens Court: Meet LaVon Lewis, Evelyn Lozada Fiance</strong></h3><p>Evelyn Lozada the star of Queens Court said Yes! Her fiance LaVon proposed to her on her birthday in December 2022. The Queens Court star got engaged to finalist LaVon Lewis after finding true love on the Peacock dating show. In reality, on Evelyn’s 47th birthday in December, the pair celebrated their relationship’s first anniversary.</p><p>“I didn’t know that he was going to propose that day,” Evelyn told in March 16 interview with People. “I didn’t know what I was walking into. He was being very sneaky and, in all honesty, I was a little irritated because I’m such an alpha female and I’m kind of like, why do I have to pack? Why do I have to do this? It was really, really difficult for me to just let go and allow him to do his thing.”</p><p>The proposal also featured a custom cake with butterflies; one side said “Happy Birthday,” while the other read, “She said, ‘Yes.'”</p><p>As reported, LaVon got down on his knees in front of their friend and family. However, getting his ladylove to the spot was no easy task. “The thing about Evelyn is, it is very hard to surprise her,” LaVon explained. “I told her to pack her bags, we’re going somewhere. She was blindfolded until she got to the front door. She walked into about 20 close friends and family and the big ‘marry me’ letters, roses on the ground, things like that.”</p><p>Evelyn adored the Twila True ring Lewis chose despite wanting to be in the know. “It was the perfect size and shape,” Lozada, who partnered with Twila True on her <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener" data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>BX Glow&nbsp;</a>jewelry line. “I’ve never had that stone, so he did a really, really good job. But I’m not surprised. Lavon is a creative mind and he doesn’t forget anything.”</p><p>In Queens Court, Evelyn dated a group of 21 men who might become their future kings, along with singers Tamar Braxton and Nivea. She first met LaVon in the second episode, and even though their chemistry deepened throughout the course of the series, the reality star was concerned that the fact that she lives in Los Angeles and he does not—could prove to be a barrier to their relationship.</p><p>Though Lozada and Lewis still live on separate coasts, she says “Lavon has been very proactive of making sure he gets on a plane to come to visit.”</p><p>Evelyn, who had a brief marriage to NFL star Chad “OchoCino” Johnson in 2012, wasn’t expecting the proposal, despite the fact that she and Lewis had previously discussed getting married. In reality, just two of Lewis’s pals and Lozada’s manager were aware of his engagement plans.</p><h3><strong>Does LaVon Lewis Have Any Kids?</strong></h3><p>LaVon Lewis has one son named Jordan from his previous relationship. Jordan is currently 13 years old and celebrated his birthday on 2 March. After Jordan heads to high school, LaVon has planned to relocate so he and Lozada can bring their family under the same roof. Over the holidays, Jordan can also meet Leo, Evelyn’s 8-year-old son.</p><p>“They were like two peas in a pod,” Evelyn said. “In the morning, Jordan would be sleeping and Leo would want to wake him up to go on the trampoline at 7:30 in the morning.”</p><p>Additionally, it should come as no surprise that LaVon wants his son to be involved in this new stage of his life given how highly he and his wife cherish their children. “I make sure he’s included in all of the conversations, so he doesn’t feel like it’s my journey. It’s our journey,” LaVon told PEOPLE. “He even texts Evelyn, ‘I love you. Goodnight.’ They’re really, really close, so I’m happy about that.”</p><h3><strong>LaVon Lewis Age</strong></h3><p>He was born in 1980.
