Robert Ho and Potier had two daughters, Sarah and Faye.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Architect, abstract artist and sixth-generation resident Ray Yip, 66, who was close friends with Robert Ho as a young man, described the house as beautiful.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'I guess now Stanley Ho has so much money, it doesn't really matter what happens to the place,' he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In June 1981, Robert Ho and Potier were killed in a car accident in Portugal. His parents were devastated by the tragedy, and his mother apparently never fully recovered her health. She died in February 2004.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ever since, according to Mr Yip and other residents, the house has slowly fallen from its former glory as it was leased out infrequently.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The property was handed to a trust for Robert Ho's children with the Hong Kong Bank Trustee Limited in 1982, according to the Land Department.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once their parents died, Sarah and Faye Ho, then three and six, respectively, were cared for by their grandfather, according to reports in the South China Morning Post at the time.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Sarah Ho, now a jewellery designer in charge of SHO Fine Jewellery in London whose designs recently graced Girls Aloud for the 2008 Brit Awards, can barely remember living in the house.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'I was very small when I was living there with my parents, so I don't remember pretty much anything at all,' she said. 'I have been back to the house to look around, but it didn't trigger any memories. I was way too young. It's a beautiful house, overlooking the sea and really stunning.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One of the tenants was a Japanese bachelor who was frequently away on business, and the once beautiful garden turned into a jungle.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Another family to live there were from New Zealand, and they managed to secure a reduced lease on the condition that they would tidy the garden.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The last tenants were the Early family. They moved out in February 2006.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Jodie Early, who still lives in Shek O, said the house had been built in a stunning location.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'It must be one of the only places in Hong Kong where you can look out from every window and not see a single building,' she said. 'You face the open sea. The air is cool and clear.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the house had decayed by the time they moved in and there were many problems.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once the family received a frightening HK$8,000 water bill. When the Water Supplies Department came to investigate, they found crudely treated sewage was flowing directly into the bay.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'They told us that if we weren't living there, no one would be allowed to move in until it was fixed,' she said. 'So there would be a lot of work that would have to be done for it to be habitable.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ms Early said she had met the girls who owned the property through the trust.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">About halfway through their tenancy, Sarah and Faye Ho, who is based in the United States, arrived with a cavalcade of cars and escorts from Shun Tak.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ms Early said one of the girls remarked as she was arriving: 'We thought we should come as we haven't been here since we were six.'</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Land Registry documents show Century Sino International paid HK$60 million to buy the house from the trust in March 2006.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The company is controlled by Stanley Ho's third wife.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Neighbours have heard that the owners may move in soon.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The fencing around the building, the piles of rubbish at the front and the numerous unopened letters strewn around the entrance may suggest otherwise.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">One neighbour, who had put some fish in the swimming pool to reduce the number of mosquitoes, said something should be done about the house.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">'It's a terrible shame really to let a house go like that, no matter how much money you have,' the neighbour added.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51krrPAyJyjnmdmZ4R1gJRompqrmaO8brfIp56sZaCWuaKvxGajnp6kYrGmr8Cy</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
