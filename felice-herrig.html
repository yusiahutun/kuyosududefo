Since being famous after her MMA career took off, many have been speculating about her family, but no information has been found to this date.</p><p>Despite that, we know her both of her parents are artists and that she has four siblings. Sadly, one of her younger brothers died at the age of two from pancreatic cancer.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>Y u gotta call me out ? RT @GrishamMMA: Watching <a href=#>@feliceherrig</a> shove carrot cake in her mouth. She likes carrot cake <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/UXQtMqp5c6</a></p><p>— Felice Herrig (@feliceherrig) <a href=#>February 24, 2017</a></p><p>As for her education, young Herrig graduated from Buffalo Grove High School back in 2003. Likewise, Felice is American by nationality, while her ethnicity is white.</p><h2>How old is Felice Herrig? – Age and Body Measurements</h2><p>Before she made it big in the UFC world, Felice practiced kickboxing and Muay Thai and even excelled at them. Thanks to that, Herrig has a strong base for fighting and has a rock-solid body. Even at the age of 37, Herrig is always pumped-up and energetic.</p><p>Likewise, Felice was born on September 18, 1984, under the star sign of Virgo. Notably, this sign is known for being a perfectionist, competitive, and hard worker.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Nicole Pechanec Bio: Age, Career, Achievements, Net worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Now, talking about her physique, Herrig stands at 5 feet 4 inches (163 cm) and weighs around 52 kgs(115 lbs). Other than muay Thai, the UFC fighter Felice also has a purple belt in Brazilian Jiu-Jitsu.</p><h2>Felice Herrig – Early Career in Kickboxing</h2><p>Before she became the “Lil’ Bulldog” that we know, Felice pursued her early career as a professional kickboxer holding a record of 23-5.</p><p>Currently, Herrig is ranked number 2 in the World in the IKF (International Kickboxing Federation) Pro Women’s Muay Thai Bantamweight Division. Not to mention, she even has an IKF title to vouch for it.</p><p>Similarly, she got the title after winning against <strong>Katie Meehan</strong> by unanimous decision on November 15, 2008. Other than that, she is also a two-time International Kickboxing Federation open Tournament Champion.&nbsp;</p><p>Felice’s first amateur win was against <strong>Terri French</strong> of Little Rock, Arkansas, back in 2005. There she became the 2005 IKF North American Classic Amateur Full Contact Rules Bantamweight Tournament Champion.</p><p>The following year, Herrig defended the title against <strong>Stacy Chung</strong> of Thunder Bay, Ontario, Canada.</p><h2>Felice Herrig – Entry to MMA aka Mixed Martial Arts</h2><p>After her successful kickboxing career, Felice then competed on Fight Girls in 2007 and won her fight against a Thai fighter.</p><p>Likewise, Herrig officially made her MMA debut on February 21, 2009, at UWC: Man “O” War, where she lost to <strong>Iman Achhal</strong>. Following the defeat, her next fight was with <strong>Michele Gutierrez</strong> at Unconquered 1: November Reign, which she won.</p><p>Moreover, Herrig then had an immensely successful MMA career as she kept winning the fights. In a short time, Herrig claimed a win against fighters like <strong>Jessica Rakoczy, Amanda LaVoy, Andrea Miller,</strong> and<strong> Nicadali Rivera-Catanoc,</strong> to name a few.</p><p>Likewise, in December 2012, Felice was meant to face <strong>Michele Gutierrez</strong> in a rematch but instead competed with <strong>Patricia Vidonic</strong> after Michele withdrew. Nonetheless, Herrig won the match via unanimous decision.</p><p>In her next fight, Felice faced <strong>Heather Clark</strong> at Bellator 94 in March 2013, which she won via split decision. However, a fight ensued post-match after Herrig unleashed a celebratory yell in her opponent’s face.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/felice-002.jpg><p>Following her win in August 2013, Felice Herrig signed a multi-fight deal with Invicta Fighting Championships. There she faced <strong>Tecia Torres</strong> at Invicta FC 7: Honchak vs. Smith on December 7, 2013, which ended up in her loss.</p><p>Not even a year later, Herrig was signed by the UFC along with ten other strawweight fighters to compete on season 20 of The Ultimate Fighter. So naturally, everyone there wanted to be the first-ever UFC women’s strawweight champion.</p><p>Likewise, Herrig was coached by <strong>Anthony Pettis</strong> but later lost the match in the quarterfinal round of the competition.</p><h2>Felice Herrig – Professional UFC Career</h2><p>With her departure from The Ultimate Fighter, Herrig sparred against <strong>Lisa Ellis</strong> at The Ultimate Fighter: A Champion Will Be Crowned Finale in 2014. Felice, aka Lil’ Bulldog, won the fight via submission in the second round.</p><p>Not long after, she faced <strong>Paige VanZant</strong> in April 2015 at UFC on Fox 15 but lost the fight via unanimous decision. Similarly, her next fight was fixed against<strong> Kailin Curran</strong> at UFC on Fox 20 in 2016, where she won the fight by rear-naked choke just two minutes into the first round.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jolene Van Vugt: Age, Height, Career, Achievements, Net worth, Instagram >></a></h4><p>Likewise, the Lil’ bulldog then faced <strong>Justine Kish</strong> at UFC Fight Night: Chiesa vs. Lee, which she won via unanimous decision. After that, Herrig won two next fights, both by unanimous decision. However, Felice failed to claim the victory once more at UFC 223 on April 7, 2018, against <a href=#><strong>Karolina Kowalkiewicz</strong></a>.</p><p>It seems luck ran out for Felice after her defeat as misfortune kept happening to her. After her another loss against <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Michelle Waterson</a>, Felice was expected to battle <strong>Xiaonan Yan</strong> at UFC 238 on June 8, 2019.</p><p>Unfortunately, just a month prior, she suffered from a torn ACL and had to pull from the event.</p><p></p><p>Moreover, her recent fight with Virna Jandiroba also ended up in a loss after via armbar submission in the first round.</p><p>Seeing her continuous loss and failed attempt at the championship has done many wonders if the Lil’ Bulldog has finally lost the charm inside the octagon. Will she get back up and prove us, or will this scenario continue? Only time can tell!</p><h2>Felice Herrig – Net Worth and Salary Estimation</h2><p>One of the known faces in the Ultimate Fighting Champions world, Felice started her career as a kickboxer and then an MMA fighter.</p><p>Utilizing her knowledge and practice of martial arts from an early age, Herrig was bound to be successful when it came to close-contact fights.</p><p>However, to this date, Felice’s actual net worth is still under review. But this has not stopped fans from speculating, and some think it is more than <strong>$150,000</strong>. Along with that, Herrig’s MMA career alone is estimated to be worth <strong>$270,500.&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Sadly, unlike other UFC fighters, Herrig’s actual profit and income after the matches are kept in the dark. This makes us oblivious about her assets and her net worth as a whole.</p><h2>Is Felice Herrig married?- Personal Life and Dating</h2><p>UFC (Ultimate Fighting Champion) fighters are indeed different from the other athletes. Other than being physically taxing, these sports also demand a lot of personal training and dedication.</p><p>It means most athletes have no time for personal indulgences.</p><p>However, many other fighters have managed to find love and settle down with their small family. Sadly, we cannot say the same when it comes to Felice; to this date, she has not shared much about her personal life.</p><p>Likewise, Herrig is already 37 years old, but we have no idea if she is married or even dating anyone at the moment. But looking past her Instagram posts, it can be said that the UFC fighter has been dating her boyfriend named <strong>Patrick Wenzel, </strong>since last year.</p><p>Besides posting several couple pictures, the American fighter has not dropped any hints and details on her beloved partner.</p><p>It does not come as a shock to us as she has been protective of her family too. Not to mention, she has yet to reveal the names of her parents and siblings to the public.</p><h4><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Tamina Snuka Bio: WWE, Net Worth, Affair, Kids, Insta Wiki >></a></h4><p>Nonetheless, the gorgeous yet fearsome Felice currently resides in Crystal Lake, Illinois, the United States of America.</p><h2>Felice Herrig – Social Media Presence</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Instagram</a>–&nbsp; 406k Followers</p><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Twitter</a>–&nbsp; 129.2k Followers</p><h2>Common Queries about Felice Herrig</h2><h3>What happened to Felice Herrig?</h3><p>Felice Herrig faced a severe knee injury.
