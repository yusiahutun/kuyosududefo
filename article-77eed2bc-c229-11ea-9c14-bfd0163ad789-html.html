Following undergraduate and graduate studies at Southern Miss and Mississippi State, Kathy and her high-school-sweetheart-turned-husband Alan moved back to Laurel. Over the next four decades, she raised three children who adored her. Kathy was a faithful member of Audubon Drive Bible Church for 40 years. She taught a girls Sunday school class and continually practiced biblical hospitality, especially to her church family, whom she dearly loved.</p><p>She was also a beloved teacher of elementary school drama and high school speech at Laurel Christian School, leaving a legacy of countless students who credit her as one of their most influential teachers. She was spunky, smart, creative and funny. Most of all she loved and worshiped her Savior Jesus Christ. Memory Chapel is in charge of arrangements. There will be a graveside service for the family this weekend.</p><p>“For from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever! Amen.” Romans 11:36.</p><p>To sign the online guestbook, visit <a href=#>www.memorychapellaurel.com</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rbHAnZyrZZOWua16wqikaKeSnsG2rdGinKxnm5bBqcWMpqarn5GjfKK%2B06KapZ2PbISmscNrmZxlk2d%2FenmQapyaZWmYfnV5wZ%2BbaWlmaK6lg5dyZaGsnaE%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
