Contentious divorce notwithstanding, neither actor has said a bad word about the other since their split in 1992.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Here's a look back at George Clooney and Talia Balsam's relationship.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1984-george-clooney-and-talia-balsam-first-meet></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1984: George Clooney and Talia Balsam first meet</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to&nbsp;Vanity Fair, Balsam and Clooney hit it off while co-starring in a "local play" in 1984. Clooney, who was just 23 at the time, was trying to establish himself as a serious actor, and you could say that Balsam, then 25, was doing the same. Still, she came from a line of Hollywood stars — her mother was actress Joyce Van Patten (sister of actor Dick Van Patten), and her father was actor Martin Balsam — and carried more clout than the&nbsp;Return of the Killer Tomatoes&nbsp;actor.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-december-1989-george-clooney-and-talia-balsam-get-married-in-las-vegas></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>December 1989: George Clooney and Talia Balsam get married in Las Vegas</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The pair's relationship wasn't without its hiccups. After dating, Balsam broke up with her beau — but not for long. They decided to get back together, and Clooney later proposed. In December 1989, the couple proclaimed their love — and spontaneity —&nbsp;with their Las Vegas wedding.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-1992-george-clooney-and-talia-balsam-divorce></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>1992: George Clooney and Talia Balsam divorce</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Ralph Dominguez/MediaPunch/Alamy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The marriage didn't last forever, and Clooney allegedly filed for divorce in late 1992. Then came the never-ending press tour. The&nbsp;ER&nbsp;star famously&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>told Barbara Walters</a>&nbsp;in 1995 during an appearance on&nbsp;20/20, "I won't marry again." His reason was that he "wasn't very good at" marriage.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I probably —&nbsp;definitely&nbsp;— wasn't someone who should have been married at that point," he told&nbsp;Vanity Fair. "I just don't feel like I gave Talia a fair shot," before adding, "I was responsible for the failure of that marriage."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Matters were further complicated when it came to legal counsel.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_21-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I would say to Talia, 'You tell me how much — what you think is fair. I'll write the check. I won't negotiate,'" he remembered. "Instead, I paid $80,000 in lawyers' fees. And that makes me crazy."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Clooney clarified his stance, as he did&nbsp;many&nbsp;times in the ensuing years,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>telling the</a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>&nbsp;Los Angeles Times</a>&nbsp;in 1997, "She didn't do anything to me. We had a relationship that didn't work out, most of it is my own fault. That's not me trying to nail me first. I can look at it like it was a TV show. I was the one in the relationship who wasn't willing to fix things."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He continued, "For me, it was about children. Everybody keeps telling me I have to have children, and they keep betting I will."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Nicole Kidman</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Michelle Pfeiffer</a>&nbsp;bet the actor $10,000 (each) that he'd have kids by 40.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"They think it's that I hate kids," he said of his reluctance to become a father, "but I adore them."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The&nbsp;Moulin Rouge&nbsp;star followed through when Clooney's 40th birthday passed, sending a check, but the actor declined to take it, countering with double or nothing for his 50th.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"I don't want to be the guy who comes in and does it half-assed, the way I've done many things in my life," Clooney said of parenthood. "The minute something is tremendously difficult, I lose some sort of interest. And I don't ever want to have the responsibility of messing somebody up like that."&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Of course, these sentiments would eventually change. In 2017, Clooney&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>became a parent</a>, welcoming twins with wife,&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Amal</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_41-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When Balsam starred on HBO's&nbsp;Divorce, naturally, she was asked about her own dealings with the title subject: how her divorce compared to that of&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sarah Jessica Parker</a>&nbsp;and Thomas Haden Church's characters.​​ "If you're trying to compare [George] to Thomas Haden Church's character, not at all," she&nbsp;<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>told&nbsp;</a><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>People</a>&nbsp;in 2016. "Absolutely, George is charming. He remains charming. I've worked with him."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wp6jnpqinsG6e9Obq2aflaS%2FqLGMnKOop56axm7AwKWgmmWSlrm0rcxmqZ6kkam2sLrSoaCp</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
