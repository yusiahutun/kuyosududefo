 'Turnip Taliban' chief Sir Jeremy Bagge, pictured in his Norfolk home Stradsett Hall, claims his controversial comments are due to having no interview training
 Stradsett Hall, near Downham Market in Norfolk, doesn't look much like a Taliban stronghold. The ornamental lake with its swans is a bit too genteel."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Then my mobile phone ran out of power and I had to stop at a telephone box which smelt like a public lavatory.</p><p>'I shoved in eight pound coins, but neither of us could hear the other very well.</p><p>'Mr Cameron told me if we stirred things up it could have a ripple effect across the whole country.

Sir Jeremy stormed out in a fury, face redder than ever, raging about 'betrayal' and 'deception' and the Machiavellian tendencies of Conservative Central Office.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i.dailymail.co.uk/i/pix/2009/11/17/article-1228710-07418F41000005DC-770_233x423.jpg height=423 width=233 alt="Elizabeth Truss" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><p class=imageCaption>Sir Jeremy was furious his local Conservative Association were not informed of Liz Truss' extra-marital affair<br></p><p>A few days on, the dust is beginning to settle and Miss Truss and her young family are settling into their new rented home in Swaffham.</p><p>So after days in the spotlight, is Sir Jeremy lying low and wishing he'd kept his mouth shut? Is he hell.</p><p>'Someone had to speak out and who better than me?' he says, big voice booming, huge brow thrust forward.</p><p>But what about the 'Taliban' jibes?<br></p><p>Yes, it's true that he's taken to wearing a turban as he potters about his Elizabethan hall.<br></p><p>'I do happen to have a Taliban hat I picked up in Pakistan, so I suppose one can play the part. I put it on occasionally. It's a very nice warm hat, actually,' he said.</p><p>Sir Jeremy is used to saying what he thinks without risk of censure (other than the occasional ticking off from the long-suffering Lady Bagge).</p><p>Take his response when he was asked in a recent interview what he thought was wrong with all-women short-lists.</p><p>'I've got absolutely nothing against women. Who cooks my lunch? Who cooks my dinner? How did my wonderful children appear?<br></p><p>'Women, you can't do without them. My God, take my wife. What does she do? She looks after me. Looks after the children. Runs the house.'</p><p>Even he looks sheepish when reminded about that comment, and after receiving an 'absolute rocketing' from Lady Bagge, he's keen to set the record straight on that point at least.</p><p>'I've got absolutely nothing against lady members of Parliament.<br></p><p>'And I must give my wife more credit than doing my cooking and producing the children. She's an absolute stalwart - so supportive it's unbelievable.</p><p>'The trouble is, I've never been trained to do interviews.<br></p><p>'Questions are fired at me, then you've got me on tape and that's it, I've lost control. So now I'm trying to be more careful, to think before I speak, which I'm finding rather hard.'</p><p>Clearly, this doesn't come naturally. Once Sir Jeremy gets going, it's impossible to stop him.<br></p><p>His chat, punctuated by huge guffaws and wide displays of rather yellow teeth, takes in tales of shooting gazelles in Africa with bows and arrows, exchanging pleasantries with his great pal the Queen - 'she's wonderful, but I know them all . . . our families have been very close for 150 years' - and this afternoon's duck shoot.</p><p>He also talks proudly of Stradsett Hall (built in 1534) which encompasses more than 1,200 acres of gardens, parkland, farming, shooting and fishing and which has been lived in by various Bagges for hundreds of years.</p><p>Finally, however, he works his way back to Liz Truss, 'that affair' and what he calls the dreadful arrogance of Conservative Central Office.</p><p>An earlier selection committee meeting (on which Sir Jeremy was not present) had rejected a previous woman applicant because of something in her CV that was considered 'embarrassing'.</p><p>Sir Jeremy explains: 'That name was binned. So we asked if there was anyone else on the list who would cause upset and we were categorically assured there was nothing that would cause us embarrassment going forward to the General Election.'</p><p>Maybe Central Office didn't think Ms Truss's affair was serious?</p><p>'If they didn't think it was important, they need their heads examining. It was an 18-month affair, not a one-off, so there must have been plenty of deceit on both sides. '</p><p>And had they known about Truss's affair, would they have ' binned' her, too?</p><p>'Quite probably. Not because of any moralising - no one's as clean as the driven snow, but we might well have thought we don't need the hassle before the next election.'</p><p>And what of Truss's Googling defence?</p><p>'I'm not in the habit of Googling people. I don't have time, I'm too busy.'</p><p>What, he's never used Google? 'Occasionally, yes, of course, to try to find out where I'm meant to be going for dinner in the City.<br></p><p>'And I used it to find out a bit more about my great-grandfather who was a midshipman and went out to the Chinese wars. . . goodness, he was an interesting man.</p><p>'But when it comes to people, I refer to my books,' he says, waving at bookshelves groaning with bronze dogs, pictures of his extended family and copies of Who's Who?, Debretts, Burke's Peerage and People Of Today - none of which are likely to contain details of Truss's affair.</p><p>In some ways he seems to belong to another era - someone who's popped out of a Jeeves and Wooster story in almost surreal contrast to the movers and shakers of Conservative Central Office, the sharp-suited, BlackBerrywielding Notting Hillbillies.</p><p>He's the sort of man who has a spaniel called Boodles - presumably named after the elite London gentleman's club.<br></p><p>His loo seat is decorated with the words 'GOOD SHOT!' and a picture of a pheasant toting a 12-bore under its wing.</p><p>He's also decked out the loo walls with an array of saucy wood carvings.</p><p>But he's no fool.<br></p><p>Like Cameron, he was educated at Eton, qualified as an accountant with Touche Ross & Co in 1968 and after stints advising the Crown Prince of Ethiopia on financial matters, ran his own consultancy from 1975 to 1983.</p><p>Since then he has held a staggering number of public offices, was High Sheriff of Norfolk between 2003 and 2004 and is a keen supporter of local charities.</p><p>And his Conservative credentials are immaculate.<br></p><p>His great-great-grandfather was a Tory MP, and he himself has spent hundreds of thousands of hours working for the Conservative Party over the years.</p><p>'We are the workers, we're the shakers and the movers, banging on the doors and introducing ourselves.<br></p><p>'And we are the people who raise the money and slice the tomatoes and dress the salads and sort out the tents for fund-raising barbecues.'</p><p>Something Mr Cameron, that self-proclaimed champion of localism, perhaps overlooked when he parachuted Miss Truss into his little patch of Norfolk.</p><p>'David Cameron talks of localism, but the fact is we are here in the constituencies. We've got a pretty good idea who we need.<br></p><p>'After all, she would be our MP, here to represent our interests, not theirs. Oh, the arrogance of these bloody little Rasputins sitting there in Central Office!'</p><p>Oh dear. His face is getting redder again.</p><p>'It's nothing short of bullying and I should know - I was bullied at school.<br></p><p>'When I was at my prep I was beaten 32 times by my headmaster and bullied by a young lad who's father was a brigadier out in Malaya.<br></p><p>'We used to have to build all our tuck boxes into a wall and he would throw knives at us - pow pow pow pow pow! So I know bullying when I see it.'</p><p>I wonder if Cameron knew what he was taking on in his battle with Sir Jeremy.<br></p><p>But the shire knight himself won't be drawn on the tensions between New Tory and Old Tory, and avoids talking about the party leader.</p><p>But I can't stop him on the iniquity of women-only short-lists.</p><p>He rails: 'Women-only short-lists? Well hang on a minute! If you're interviewing for a company or a bank, you've got to have a short-list of the best and whether you're a lady or a man shouldn't matter.'</p><p>So what of the future - will he stay loyal to the party?</p><p>'I'll vote Conservative, even if I'm not always terribly proud to be one. I'm not trying to drive a wedge between the party.<br></p><p>'We all believe in the same thing but we need to pull together and show a bit of mutual respect.'<br></p><p>And Ms Truss - now she's been finally selected as his constituency's candidate, will he get behind her?</p><p>'I think she's a very able young lady, but I do think that if one is coming up to an area such as Norfolk, it helps to understand it.</p><p>'I gather there were some 45 people locally who put their names forward but they didn't get through Central Office.<br></p><p>'Which is a shame, because they know how the area ticks and what's happening. If you're a complete outsider, where do you start?'</p><p>And finally, what about those offensive nicknames: the 'Norfolk Neanderthals' and the 'Turnip Taliban'?</p><p>'Norfolk Neanderthal? I don't really understand how we can get these titles. I'm not so bothered by the Turnip bit, but Taliban does upset me.<br></p><p>'Of course they're mountain goats and they're bloody good fighters with a long history, but I don't like their technique with regards to the way they blow up our troops.'</p><p>And with that, his next appointment arrives - half a dozen chaps dressed in immaculate tweedy greens ready for a bit of duck shooting - and we say farewell, him waving cheerily.</p><p>Sir Jeremy is an extraordinary man. He is clumsy and old-fashioned.<br></p><p>But he is also working hard for other people and loves this country and the Conservative Party.<br></p><p>And, perhaps most importantly, he has no fear of speaking out when he senses the young slick metropolitan Tories are getting just a bit too big for their non-muddy boots.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKaVrMBwrdGtoJyklWJ%2Bc36YcGdtZ3mieqO706Gcq52UYqG2vs2ip2aamal6la3Lopmapl2ZvKa%2FjK6nrJ2kYqCqvoyDnKudna56g63GoJxmqpWrsqK40maroaelnLW1v4yNpquxXZy%2FsMHPrGSnoZOgu6K5xKxloaydoQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
