This means that she is either 22 or 23 years old as of 2022. The <a href=#>celebrity</a> was given the name William Thomas at birth but changed to Lia Catherine Thomas after her gender transition.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5db120485e08fae4.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Where does DanTDM live?

From there, she joined the University of Pennsylvania, where she competed in both the men's and women's swimming competitions. She graduated in 2022 and plans to enrol in<a href=#> law school </a>to pursue a career as a civil rights attorney.</p><h2>Career beginning</h2><p class=align-left>In her early career, Thomas was a swimmer on the men's team at the University of Pennsylvania in 2017. As a freshman, she managed a time of 8 minutes and 57.55 seconds in the 1,000-yard freestyle, ranking as the sixth-fastest national men's time. In the 500-yard and 1,650-yard categories, she managed to rank within the national top 100.</p><p class=align-left>In 2018-2019, Thomas came second in the men's 500, 1,000, and 1,650-yard freestyle at the Ivy League championships. That season, she recorded the top university men's teams in the 500 free, 1000 free, and 1650 free.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3b2deb8611d05c3b.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who was Ariana Fletcher's brother and what happened to him?</span></p></a><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/30c4c562da9ba09a.jpg><h2>Transitioning to female</h2><p class=align-left>Lia started her transition in May 2019 with the help of hormone replacement therapy. During her junior year, she revealed to her coaches, friends and teammates that she was transgender. At the time she was undergoing hormone therapy, she was required to swim for the men's team.</p><p class=align-left>When Thomas was competing in the men's team, she was ranked 554 in the 200 freestyle, 65 in the 500 freestyle, and 32 in the 1650 freestyle. However, that has changed in the women's team because she currently ranks 5 in the 200 freestyle, first in the 500 freestyle, and eighth in the 1650 freestyle.</p><h2>Controversial success</h2><p class=align-left>Controversies have followed Lia Thomas since she came out as transgender. She started questioning her gender towards the end of <a href=#>high school</a>, but it was not until the summer of 2018, after her first year, that she came out as transgender. She officially started using her new name on New Year's Day in 2020.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/ba7af3af24c452d6.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Did Frank Fritz ever get married?

She lost to four cisgender women and a transgender man. In March, she became the first openly transgender athlete to win an NCAA Division I national championship in any <a href=#>sport</a> by winning the women's 500-yard freestyle at a time of 4:33:24.</p><p class=align-left>This was her last college swimming event. From Lia Thomas' records, she is ranked number one on the women's team in the 500-yard freestyle and 5th in the 200-yard freestyle. After that, she applied to join law school and is expected to swim at the 2024 summer Olympics trials.</p><p class=align-left>In June 2022, the International Swimming Federation (FINA), the organization that administers international aquatic sports competitions, voted to bar all transgender athletes from competing in professional women's swimming, except for those who have not experienced any part of male puberty beyond Tanner Stage 2.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/8729707a967a881f.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=31><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Brian Quinn's family, wife, daughter, illness, Impractical Jokers</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Thomas was barred from competing in the women's competition at the 2024 Paris Olympics as she had planned. In response, Thomas said, "The new FINA release is deeply upsetting. It is discriminatory and will only serve to harm all women. "Despite all these, the University of Pennsylvania nominated her for the 2022 NCAA Woman of the Year Award.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/5db120485e08fae4.jpg><h2>Public debate</h2><p class=align-left>The controversial participation of Lia in the women's team evoked public debate in the United States. Parents of the University of Pennsylvania <a href=#>swim team </a>members asked the NCAA to declare Thomas ineligible to compete. Towards the end of 2021, USA swimming official Cynthia Millen resigned after 30 years to protest Lia's eligibility.</p><p class=align-left>While she faced opposition from some factions of media and organizations, she also received support from others. The University of Pennsylvania Law School, the Ivy League, and several other organizations supported her.</p><h2>Sexuality</h2><p class=align-left>It is difficult to speculate Lia's sexuality because she was previously a man who transitioned to a <a href=#>transgender person</a>. In addition, she has never revealed any relationship details in the entire duration she has been in the limelight. She is believed to be single as of 2022.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0bf4f23062331c86.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amanda Balionis bio: golf career, salary, marriage, background</span></p></a><h2>Net worth</h2><p class=align-left>While making headlines due to the controversy of being a transgender athlete, Lia Thomas has been making the same money.
