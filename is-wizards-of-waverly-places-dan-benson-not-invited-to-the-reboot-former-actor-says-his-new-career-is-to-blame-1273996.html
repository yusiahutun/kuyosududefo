Former Actor Says His New Career</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-09-01</div><p>Former actor Daniel Lee Benson, who worked in the American Sitcom Wizards of Waverly Place, told TMZ that he is at once happy and sad about the new reboot of the show. Dan is glad that the show is getting a reboot, and the new generation of children will be able to witness the magic of the Disney Channel classic. But he is also sad that he will not be able to be a part of this, and it is all due to his career choices.</p><br><h2 id=65b2b6f8a3741><strong>Why won’t Dan Benson be a part of the new reboot?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>Dan Benson played the role of Zeke Beakerman in the original Wizards of Waverly Place. And even though most of the stars of the show have gone on to have different careers, Benson's career has probably had the most drastic change.&nbsp;</p><p>The former actor mentioned that even though he is sad about the fact that he will never be a part of this project anymore, he does not blame anyone for not getting a call. As Benson has been an adult content creator on Only Fans for a few years now, he feels that he is the one who blocked all chances of ever getting back on that show for himself.&nbsp; <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>The Rick and Morty actor has been an adult content creator since 2022 and understands that he cannot be a part of a children's show anymore, no matter how much he wants it. He said, "I put the chance of bringing back the character I played away when I decided to go along this path of becoming an adult content creator." Further, he does not blame the show's producers, as they also had their hands tied in this matter.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p>Benson posted a <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Is Wizards Of Waverly Place&#39;s Dan Benson Not Invited To The Reboot?

He is very keen for people to see all their favorite show characters again on screen. Benson also said that he loved the show's premise, which will revolve around Justin Russo, his family, and his new wizard apprentice.&nbsp;</p><p>Justin Russo will be played by David Henrie, who played the role in the original sitcom. <a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Is Wizards Of Waverly Place&#39;s Dan Benson Not Invited To The Reboot?
