The country cutie graces the cover of the January issue of Marie Claire, where she opens up about her chosen career, married life with Blake Shelton and her super-slim bod.
The 30-year-old beauty recently lost 20-pounds, and she admits that she's felt the pressure to be thin.

"But everybody's making this big, giant thing about it. It's way too much focus on <a href=#><strong>women's bikini photos</strong></a>, and I hate it. Why do we care? I want women to love themselves whatever they've got going on."</p><p>"When you have to walk out there in front of thousands of people, it does feel good to know that your s**t's not jiggling," she adds.</p><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2f/o/2014/12/08/2f3626cfd53a5d5eb219892ee3bf5c17_md.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p>While the <strong>"Somethin' Bad"</strong> singer hasn't always been comfortable with her body, she's certainly secure about her marriage to Shelton.</p><p>"I'm not sunshine and roses," she admits. "Blake's the happiest person on the planet. He pulls me out of my darkness … Literally everything is the best about being married."</p><p>Miranda, who is hitting the road this month for her <strong>"Certified Platinum"</strong> tour, isn't afraid to speak her mind through her music ... as long as she's keeping it real.</p><p>"Early on, an artist told me, 'Don't be yourself. Perform and be someone else. And I thought, 'That seems like exactly the opposite of what I should be doing,'" she reveals.</p><p>"Then I had people wanting me to adjust my lyrics to be more appealing to the masses or whatever. I said, 'No, that's bullshit.' I'd rather sell four copies of something that's real than 4 million copies of something that's fake."</p><p>Gotta love that attitude!</p><p>Read the Miranda's full interview, pick up the January issue of Marie Claire, on stands December 16.
