  And on Saturday, the actress did exactly just that, demonstrating to fans how she spent her weekend over on Instagram. In a photo shared to her grid, Halle was seemingly not wearing a stitch of clothing when she stepped out on her balcony to take in the breathtaking views from her Malibu mansion while unwinding with a glass of vino."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In a photo shared to her grid, Halle was seemingly not wearing a stitch of clothing when she stepped out on her balcony to take in the breathtaking views from her Malibu mansion while unwinding with a glass of vino.

Stepping fresh out of the shower (or bathtub), the actress snapped a selfie in a mirror filled with steam with a huge smile on her face, writing in the caption: "hump day self love."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57x5qjpZ1dl7Kzvthmm6uhnqC2r7OMsKCnnV2jrqyxw2agp6uklrSzrcxmbmxvZ2eGeA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
