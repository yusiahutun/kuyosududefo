Per Indiana State Police (ISP), no family members, witnesses or acquaintances came forward to help identify the child, while tips were unsuccessful.</p><p>Even the autopsy "shed little light on the investigation," said police, as the cause of death was determined to be "electrolyte imbalance," likely caused by a "viral gastroenteritis," or dehydration. He wasn't identified for another six months. After that, a warrant for Anderson's arrest was issued on charges of murder, neglect of a dependent resulting in death and obstruction of justice.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:9be29af5-aaf3-455a-8def-b98f641fb443 data-container-ref=toofab:article:2edd31ea-92b0-40de-9858-d04a7d0048ef data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/d1/5by4/2022/10/27/d1fb7b2cc10f417e8cc33cf3ca0d5596_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Indiana State Police</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Mother of Boy Found Dead In Suitcase by Mushroom Hunter Wanted for Murder, Called Him 'Demonic' on Facebook</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>During her bond hearing Tuesday,</strong></a> Anderson got things off to an odd start after being asked her name.</p><p>First, she said her name was Princess, before listing off a bunch of additional surnames. Then she said she was there "representing the entity Dejaune Anderson."</p><p>Anderson then told the judge she planned to file a motion to represent herself during her trial. When asked whether she understood everything that comes along with defending herself, Anderson said, "I do understand. I have a masters in history."</p><p>"That doesn't give you a law degree," the judge told her, before she replied, "But I do understand how to read procedures and understand the court procedures." When he then told her that still didn't ensure herself "a good lawyer," she responded, "that's a personal opinion, but I understand."</p><p>She went on to explain that her decision wasn't because she couldn't afford a lawyer, but because she was privy to "classified evidence" involving other open cases and federal investigations.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:e281fc8e-f4e4-4a84-8e68-a5f18f1fb7ce data-container-ref=toofab:article:2edd31ea-92b0-40de-9858-d04a7d0048ef data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=28><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/32/5by4/2022/11/22/322672f8a11b4bbb8ae8ff98d9f202b6_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Indiana State Police</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Woman Accused of Aiding In Murder of Boy Found Dead In Suitcase Admitted Dumping Body: Police</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>The issue of bond was then addressed, as state prosecutors argued it should be set at a high amount or taken off the table completely as she was considered a "fugitive" for two years.</p><p>"I object," Anderson said as the prosecutor spoke, before the judge gave her the floor to explain why she felt keeping her on bond was unnecessary.</p><p>"The basis of my objection is the fact that I am not a fugitive. I have been under NSA surveillance for the past 8 months and how can that qualify me as a fugitive on the run when I've also had a detail from Space Force that was following my every move?" she asked.</p><p>The judge told her that wasn't a legal objection, however, and said that if she planned to represent herself, she better learn proper court procedure quickly. If she didn't, he said, "you have no chance in the world, lady."</p><p>Anderson reiterated her claim about both the NSA and Space Force, also claiming she turned herself into to the the U.S. Marshals, something which does not appear to be the case. For those reasons, she said, she shouldn't be slapped with an "astronomical bond."</p><p>"It's my understanding [officers] have been in touch with almost every one of those agencies and they haven't been able to identify your location until recently," the judge told her, before denying bond. "If Space Force comes forward and tells me they’re willing to monitor you, we’ll take up the issue of bond at a later time," he added.</p><p>The judge also decided that, "based upon what I've just heard," he'd be assigning a public defender to her case, who could be removed in the future if needed.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:0cb47cba-6c3c-4d4b-a2df-844c0a19ee1f data-container-ref=toofab:article:2edd31ea-92b0-40de-9858-d04a7d0048ef data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=29><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/85/5by4/2024/01/24/85acfe258e1c4ff09c607b0cfe1db337_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">San Francisco Police Department</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Pair Convicted for Gruesome Murder of Man They Tortured, Injected with Fentanyl and Stuffed In Suitcase</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Dawn Coleman -- a friend of the victim's mother -- was also arrested and pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit murder in connection with the boy's death. She was sentenced to 30 years, with 5 years suspended.</p><p>Coleman claimed the boy was already dead when she came into a bedroom and saw Anderson on top of him. She then helped her friend dispose of the body.</p><p>According to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">NBC</a>, Anderson made reference to an exorcism in regards to her son and using her blood for a ritual also involving him. Shortly before his death, she also reportedly mentioned "a very powerful demonic force from within my son" and spoke of possession in March.</p><p>In April, days before his body was found, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">she is said have wrote,</a> "I have survived the death attacks from my 5-year-old throughout the 5 years he has been alive.
