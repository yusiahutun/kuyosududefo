Cosco now owns 75 per cent of OOIL.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After lengthy negotiations, OOIL and Cosco signed the agreement with the US Departments of Homeland Security and jJustice, promising to sell the terminals to “a suitable, unrelated third party” deemed “acceptable” to the US department.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The second largest port by volume, Long Beach imported 6.8 million TEU (twenty-foot equivalent units) in 2016, more than New York and second only to Los Angeles, according to data from the World Shipping Council.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The buyer was identified on Tuesday as an unlisted North American fund called Macquarie Infrastructure Partners (MIP).</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">MIP is managed by Macquarie Infrastructure and Real Assets, one of the world’s biggest asset managers with A$185.9 billion (US$130.91 billion) assets in infrastructure, real estate, agriculture and energy. It is part of the Sydney-headquartered financial conglomerate Macquarie Group.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">OOIL’s share price rose 3.5 per cent to close at HK$53 on Tuesday after the deal was announced in the morning, while its controlling shareholder Cosco Shipping gained 1.1 per cent to close at HK$3.65. The broader Hang Seng Index fell by 0.7 per cent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“The announcement of the buyer for the Long Beach Terminal is positive to both OOIL and Cosco Shipping as it removes the uncertainties about who will buy the assets,” said Jeffrey Chan, a founding partner of Hong Kong-based Oriental Patron Financial Group. “The deal also provides cash for the company to do other expansion of ports or its shipping businesses.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Cosco’s purchase of OOIL springboarded owners Tung Chee-hwa and his brother Chee-chen into 17th place in the 2018 Forbes Hong Kong Rich List as their combined wealth surged 73 per cent to US$5.1 billion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Over the past 30 years, we have developed Long Beach Container Terminal into the safest, most efficient and lowest-emission terminal in the United States,” said Andy Tung, co-chief executive of OOIL.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The deal requires OOIL to continue to use the Long Beach Terminal for a 20-year period for an agreed vessel and rail tariff. If it is unable to meet the minimum volume commitment, OOIL must pay for the shortfall, the company announcement said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Karl Kuchel, chief executive of MIP, said his company wanted to buy the Long Beach port because it serves as a gateway for trans-Pacific trade.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“We are also committed to completing the current expansion of Long Beach Container Terminal by 2022, which will significantly increase the capacity of the terminal,” Kuchel said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">OOIL said it has not yet decided how to use the cash it gains from the transaction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Long Beach terminal had an audited net book value of US$345.24 million as of the end of last year.
