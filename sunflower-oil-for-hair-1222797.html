It is a common kitchen staple in India and is used in many households as cooking oil due to its rich nutritional profile. It is densely packed with healthy fats such as linoleic acid, oleic acid, and vitamin E (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Sunflower Oil For Hair: The Secret to Healthy And Strong Mane","1222797","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5976617/#:~:text=Sunflower%20oil%20contains%20approximately%2015,its%20unsaturated%20fatty%20acid%20content.","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/sunflower-oil-for-hair-1222797","1","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>1</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><p>The golden-yellow oil has a neutral taste and fitness freaks love to incorporate a teaspoon of sunflower oil in their salads.

Here are the top reasons to include sunflower oil in your beauty regimes.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h2 id=6579bdd8bcd0e><strong>Top Benefits of Using Sunflower Oil for Hair</strong></h2><p>Have you ever noticed how healthy your granny’s hair is? Her secret to long, thick, and lustrous hair probably is the regular use of herbal oils. Let’s count on some exceptional <strong>benefits of sunflower oil for hair</strong> and scalp health.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=6579bdd8bcd13><strong>1. Fights Dandruff</strong></h3><p>What can be more irritating than those tiny white flakes in your hair? Dandruff, scientifically known as Seborrheic Dermatitis is a scalp condition that mainly affects the scalp and leads to the formation of tiny white flakes made up of dead skin. Dandruff may also cause scalp irritation, itching, and red patches. These symptoms are not only discomforting but may be difficult to manage.&nbsp;</p><p>Sunflower oil comes packed with natural antioxidants that help improve scalp health by reducing inflammation, itchiness, and redness. Also, the antimicrobial compounds in the natural oil help fight dandruff-causing microbes and lower the risk of scalp infections.</p><h3 id=6579bdd8bcd18><strong>2. Speeds up Hair Growth</strong></h3><p><img alt="Speeds up Hair Growth" title="Speeds up Hair Growth" width=1279 height=854 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-05/1685015191_pexels-tim-mossholder-1049687.jpg></p><p>Our contributor, Corrigan Duffy, who is a chef and food blogger shares his insights about sunflower oil. He says, “Keeping your hair moisturized promotes hair growth by preventing breakage and hair loss, as well as maintaining the overall health of the hair and scalp. Also, it helps maintain the natural structure of the hair shaft and prevents split ends, which is the key to stimulating the hair growth cycle.” Nowadays, most of us undergo a variety of heat and chemical treatments that rips off the natural oils and moisture from the hair strands. This eventually leads to dry and damaged hair that affects the hair growth cycle (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Sunflower Oil For Hair: The Secret to Healthy And Strong Mane","1222797","https://www.researchgate.net/publication/51858708_Hair_Shaft_Damage_from_Heat_and_Drying_Time_of_Hair_Dryer","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/sunflower-oil-for-hair-1222797","2","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>2</u></a>).</p><p>Sunflower oil is infused with linoleic & oleic fatty acids and makes a great moisturizer for dry and unruly hair (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Sunflower Oil For Hair: The Secret to Healthy And Strong Mane","1222797","http://troindia.in/journal/ijcesr/vol6iss1part3/1026-1031.pdf","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/sunflower-oil-for-hair-1222797","3","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>3</u></a>). Besides, high concentrations of vitamin E in sunflower oil deeply nourish the hair follicles and stimulate the natural hair growth cycle (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Sunflower Oil For Hair: The Secret to Healthy And Strong Mane","1222797","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3819075/","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/sunflower-oil-for-hair-1222797","4","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>4</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><h3 id=6579bdd8bcd1e><strong>3. Gives You Voluminous Hair</strong></h3><p><img alt="Gives You Voluminous Hair" title="Gives You Voluminous Hair" width=1280 height=853 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/images/2023-05/1685015216_pexels-nitin-khajotia-1485993.jpg></p><p>A common problem most people face after a relaxing oil massage session is that it weighs down their hair and decreases volume even after shampooing. While thick oils such as castor or mustard oil may leave some greasiness on the scalp even after a thorough shampooing, things are pretty different with sunflower oil. The cold-pressed sunflower oil has a non-greasy texture and does not weigh your hair down after a rich champi session (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Sunflower Oil For Hair: The Secret to Healthy And Strong Mane","1222797","http://troindia.in/journal/ijcesr/vol6iss1part3/1026-1031.pdf","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/sunflower-oil-for-hair-1222797","3","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>3</u></a>). The non-greasy texture of sunflower oil makes it a great ingredient for several oil-infused shampoos and conditioners available in the market today.&nbsp;</p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><h3 id=6579bdd8bcd25><strong>4. Prevents Splitends</strong></h3><p>Do split ends cause hair fall? Split ends are not only unsightly but hinder your hair growth as well. Split ends occur when your hair strands lose their natural moisture and their ends divide into two, thus halting the natural hair growth cycle. Since sunflower oil is a natural emollient, it deeply moisturizes your hair and repairs the hair shaft, thus making them look smooth and shiny (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Sunflower Oil For Hair: The Secret to Healthy And Strong Mane","1222797","http://troindia.in/journal/ijcesr/vol6iss1part3/1026-1031.pdf","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/sunflower-oil-for-hair-1222797","3","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>3</u></a>).&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>5.

A high concentration of vitamin E in sunflower oil helps to revive the shine and texture of your hair.&nbsp;</p><h3><strong>6.

The natural fats in sunflower oil replace the lost moisture in the hair strands and revive their natural texture, thus making them smooth, shiny, and manageable. The light and non-greasy oil may penetrate the hair strands and create a thin layer of fats around the hair shaft, which protects them against heat or environmental damage. Besides, it decreases surface friction, thus resulting in frizz-free hair (<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Sunflower Oil For Hair: The Secret to Healthy And Strong Mane","1222797","https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4387693/","articlepage","/beauty/hair-care/sunflower-oil-for-hair-1222797","7","Body_Hyperlink","beauty","hair-care")'><u>7</u></a>). Curly hair is more likely to be frizzy than straight hair.

The antimicrobial compounds in raw sunflower oil help fight dandruff and improve scalp health. Sunflower oil shares a versatile use and can be added to your DIY hair masks for added benefits. Undoubtedly, it is beneficial to use <strong>sunflower oil for hair</strong>, however, it’s important to perform a patch test to avoid pollen allergies or any irritation.
