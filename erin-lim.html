Most significantly, she had been nominated for The 38th Annual People's Choice Awards (2012). In this article, we will talk about her love life and the unexpected death of her fiance.</h3><h2>Is Erin Lim Currently in a Relationship?</h2><p>The 28 years old Erin Lim has been dating the television personality, <strong>Lamorne Morris</strong>, 36. Although Lim and Morris fell in love in mid-2016, they made their affair public in September 2017.</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/04/06/lim-snapped-with-boyfriend-lamorne-morris--1586190152.jpg width=450 height=566 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Lim snapped with boyfriend, Lamorne Morris. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Pinterest</strong></span><p>In summer 2018, the lovely couple came to be the headline of many news, suspected having a secret wedding after Erin posted a vacation photo together with the comedian in a cozy place located in France. But, the rumor turned out to be completely fake.</p><strong><img id=postimg src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/img.marriedwiki.com/uploads/2020/04/06/erin-taylor-and-her-lover-morris-is-still-unmarried--1586190311.jpg width=450 height=675 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto><span class=imageCaption>Erin Taylor and her lover, Morris is still unmarried. </span></strong><span class=imageSource><strong>SOURCE: Zimbio</strong></span><p>To tell you the truth, the E-News host has not yet shared the wedding vows with the BET's actor, Morris. However, they have been dating for almost four years. Even though there is no sign, the lovey-dovey duo will get apart. Hence, they have maintained a healthy relationship.</p><h2>Erin's Ex-Fiance Sudden Death, While Playing a Prank</h2><p>The actress previously was engaged to the prankster, <strong>Emeka Udechuku</strong>, in late 2015.
