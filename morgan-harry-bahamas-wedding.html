Morgan, who led the global strategic partnership relations team at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.artsy.net/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Artsy class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Artsy</a> for five years, and Harry, a private equity investor, were fresh out of college and working in the same office in Boston when they first met. “We were in direction competition in the office—and we were both seeing other people at the time,” Morgan says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But for Harry, the story goes another way. “When Morgan says it wasn't love at first sight, it means she didn’t have any interest in me. From those early days, I was head over heels for her and spent the better half of two years convincing her to take a leap of faith on me,” he counters. After spending far too long in the friend zone, Harry made his move: putting pen to paper for an old-fashioned love letter. It paid off, and the two started dating four years (and one city) later.</p><img alt="morgan ritter armour and harry fackelmayer" title="morgan ritter armour and harry fackelmayer" width=1080 height=918 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/12-1596827947.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="morgan ritter armour and harry fackelmayer" title="morgan ritter armour and harry fackelmayer" width=717 height=720 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-45-10-1596827715.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">A few weeks after their courtship began in New York City, Harry got a job offer in California. “He asked me if he should take it,” recalls Morgan. “I didn’t want to hold him back and encouraged him to go, but regretted it when we ended up dating long distance for the ensuing two years.” It was a good test of resilience though, priming the couple for when they moved in together in San Francisco 14 months later.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Their relationship flourished—in part because they are, as Morgan puts it, simultaneously very similar and different. “We share values, goals, and dreams. Our friends and family would say we’re both warm and cheerful. Harry is immensely energetic, passionate, loyal, driven, and ambitious. He’s also the funniest person I know and makes any situation a bit more outrageous and amusing. I’m more contemplative, measured, and patient.” And while individuals on their own rite, it’s all about that balance for them. “Morgan balances me and I am 100% a better person because of her. I respect Morgan to her core and count my blessings every day, constantly reminding myself just how lucky I am and how glad I am to have written that letter,” Harry explains.</p><img alt="harbour island, bahamas" title="harbour island, bahamas" width=717 height=720 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-11-06-1596828046.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="morgan ritter armour and harry fackelmayer" title="morgan ritter armour and harry fackelmayer" width=1080 height=902 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/4-1596828167.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="harbour island, bahamas" title="harbour island, bahamas" width=720 height=715 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-12-15-1596828122.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The following summer, they were back East for the Fourth of July, relaxing at the Jersey Shore in a tiny town the bride and her family have frequented for decades. “One of my favorite things to do there is walk the beach and look for sea glass. Harry typically has limited patience for this, so I sensed something was up when he suggested we do some beach combing before dinner,” Morgan says.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=10 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When they got down to the beach, and he asked the big question, she immediately burst into tears. To the point where she forgot to say “yes” right away. Upon finally verbally accepting his proposal, she slipped on the engagement ring, fashioned from a cushion-cut diamond from a ring previously belonging to his maternal grandmother and reset in yellow gold by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.simonteakle.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Simon Teakle" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Simon Teakle</a>. Then they were off to celebrate with margaritas, family and friends, and a quiet dinner.</p><img alt="morgan harry" title="morgan harry" width=720 height=480 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-md-141-2-1596828238.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="morgan and her bridesmaids" title="morgan and her bridesmaids" width=720 height=720 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-09-03-1596828260.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="morgan and her maid of honor" title="morgan and her maid of honor" width=720 height=481 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-65-06-1596828284.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">When it came time to plan the wedding, the bride and groom considered various locations across the hemisphere, including California and Mexico, but ultimately couldn’t shake the idea of getting married in the Bahamas on Harbour Island. The picturesque location in the Caribbean carried significance; Morgan and Harry had spent a lot of happy times as a couple there, and as a child Morgan visited often with her family. Although tricky to get to, they couldn’t resist bringing all the people they love to a place so beloved by them.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">With help from San Francisco-based (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/wedding/planning/g6965/best-wedding-planners/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="and BAZAAR Bride top planner" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">and BAZAAR Bride top planner</a>) Rosemary Hattenbach of <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.rosemaryevents.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Rosemary Events" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Rosemary Events</a>, they began planning a multi-event wedding weekend culminating with a wedding at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.ilovetheoceanview.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Ocean View Club" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the Ocean View Club</a>. “The island is tiny and operates on its own schedule, so Rosemary was key in helping us to avoid any Fyre Festival scenarios,” recalls Morgan of orchestrating the event’s multiple gatherings and moving pieces.<br></p><img alt="the welcome party tablescape" title="the welcome party tablescape" width=1080 height=1139 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/9-1596828452.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="the welcome dinner" title="the welcome dinner" width=720 height=480 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-md-297-1596828383.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="the welcome dinner" title="the welcome dinner" width=1080 height=1218 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/13-1596828483.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="the welcome dinner" title="the welcome dinner" width=480 height=720 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-md-589-1596828872.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The couple arrived a week before the festivities began.

Taking their cue from the setting, and with a dose of Wes Anderson style, they printed menus on the backs of vintage Bahamian postcards, dressed tables with floral arrangements coming out of conch shells and star fish by <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/wedding/planning/g8296/best-wedding-florists-in-america/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="BAZAAR Bride Top Wedding Florist" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">BAZAAR Bride Top Wedding Florist</a> <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://sarahwinward.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sarah Winward" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sarah Winward</a>, stitched table numbers onto locally-sourced leaves, and hung straw lanterns from the ceiling.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In true beach fashion, Morgan went barefoot, but slipped into an <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.amandawakeley.com/uk/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Amanda Wakeley" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Amanda Wakeley</a> dress, her great grandmother’s pearl-and-diamond-studs, and her grandmother’s pearl bracelet with a shell clasp. Toasts from friends and family were the highlight of the evening. The bride’s sister surprised the group by performing Ben Harper’s “Steal My Kisses,” accompanied by her boyfriend who learned how to play it on his ukulele just for the occasion. After toasts and tears of joy flowed at dinner, the celebrating continued as guests headed to a local bar called <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bahamas.com/vendor/gustys-night-club data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=Gusty’s class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Gusty’s</a> for late night cocktails.</p><img alt="pool party" title="pool party" width=720 height=481 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-33-26a-1596828973.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="pool party" title="pool party" width=720 height=481 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-36-30a-1596828996.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The following morning, everyone hopped aboard boats for a 15-minute ride to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.ontheos.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="The Other Side" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">The Other Side</a> on Eleuthra, to enjoy the day on the eco-resort. Like the Ocean View Club, the property is owned by Ben and Charlie Simmons—it's simply on the other side of it. The elegantly rustic setting made for the perfect backdrop for a Bahamian barbecue, complete with local conch salad (the bride’s favorite), jerk chicken, Goombay Smashes (a cocktail of light, gold, dark, and coconut rum mixed with fresh pineapple and orange juices), board games, sunbathing, and swimming.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">After fun in the sun, everyone made their way back to Harbour Island to rest up for the big day. Kind of. There was one more gathering lined up that evening: a casual beach bonfire at The Dunmore with a bit of stargazing too. Another laid-back component to the four days of celebrating? The couple’s photographer. After doing a lot of research, they selected <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/wedding/planning/g7155/best-wedding-photographers/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="BAZAAR Bride Top Wedding Photographer" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">BAZAAR Bride Top Wedding Photographer</a> <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://johndolan.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="John Dolan" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">John Dolan</a> to document it all. “I liked John’s more casual and realistic approach,” Morgan says. “When we met him in person, we knew right away we had made the right decision.” Adds Harry, “John is incredibly talented but an even better person.

Shells, coral, seahorses, fish, an anchor, a turtle, and a squid, lobster, and starfish adorned the skirt along with hand-written quotes (like a Toni Morrison favorite) and the wedding date (June 1, 2019).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“They were not only respectful and patient with my vision, but they also invested an incredible amount of time, effort, and craftsmanship in creating my dream dress,” the bride tells BAZAAR Bride of the team at the London design house, who spent over 1000 hours executing the detailed, bespoke design. The custom sheath with an open back was completely befitting of the location—and Morgan and Harry’s love story. As was the custom veil, also by Hermione de Paula, embroidered at the edges with a poem written by Morgan’s grandmother to her on the day she was born.</p><img alt="the ceremony" title="the ceremony" width=1195 height=1200 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-30-01-1596829166.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="the guests at the ceremony" title="the guests at the ceremony" width=1080 height=1620 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/6-1596829286.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="the ceremony" title="the ceremony" width=1080 height=1419 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/3-1596829221.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="the couple, just married" title="the couple, just married" width=1200 height=802 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-37-06a-1596829192.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><img alt="just married" title="just married" width=717 height=720 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/2019-22-43-02-1596829252.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">John Dolan</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=38 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Morgan's bouquet, created by Sarah Winward, embraced the foraged, sea-inspired look, incorporating dried lunaria, which shimmered like the inside of a seashell.
