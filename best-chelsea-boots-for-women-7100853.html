The traditional style of the easy pull-on boot, which is usually made with leather and elastic gores and hits under the calf and above the ankle, has become a mainstream, must-have silhouette, according to fashion experts.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Identified by its clean, utilitarian look, it is arguably one of the hardest working shoes in your closet,” says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Kyla Flax</a>, head of styling at Anthropologie, who pairs hers with everything from a long dress and an <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>oversized blazer</a> to the simplest of jeans-and-a-tee outfit. While many designers lean into the clean classic status of the Chelsea, today there are varying styles with updated design details like bright colors, platform lug soles, higher ankle shafts, and new toe shapes. After speaking to style experts and raiding our own closets, we found the best Chelsea boots that are comfortable to wear, durable, and go with all kinds of outfits.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-marc-fisher-ltd-womens-yale-pointy-toe-chelsea-bootie></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Marc Fisher LTD Yale Chelsea Bootie</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Marc Fisher LTD Women&amp;rsquo;s Yale Pointy Toe Chelsea Bootie" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/HXt2NwsxtNQwa4iUrGr3njnJPR8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/marc-fisher-ltd-yale-pointy-toe-chelsea-bootie-b817112a5b4c417980c70f0dac1ee825.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The shorter heel, lower shaft height, and neutral colorways give the boots a universal look you can take with you everywhere, throughout all four seasons.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The sizing runs small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Consider the Marc Fisher Yale boots as the foundation of every outfit moving forward. They stop just short of ankle height and flatter any kind of bottom from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>swing skirts</a> to raw-edged denim. We’re also fond of additional design details like the sharp pointed toe, V-shaped sides, and metal accents, that jazz up the silhouette. No way these will fall by the wayside of your boring everyday footwear — the gorgeous glossy leather and soft suede materials wouldn’t allow for that — but they’re still so endlessly versatile. And, you can send your style soaring by pairing it with a brightly colored bobby or lace-trimmed sock peeking out of the edge. One more note: We’d recommend sizing up for the most comfortable fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–11 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 3 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 1.5 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-vepose-chelsea-ankle-booties></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vepose Chelsea Ankle Booties</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vepose Chelsea Ankle Booties " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/FzpHFSGRiNjEa-fBMYglLEGNIqI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vepose-chlsea-ankle-booties-2b5c225cf67a47dc9c0688da094f142f.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The non-slip rubber sole makes walking on wet surfaces easy as well.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The non-leather material can scuff easily.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It’s typically not easy to find Chelsea boots that are affordable because their signature material, leather, is not cheap. Swap it out for something vegan, like this synthetic leather, and you can slash the price down and go animal-free in one go. But don’t worry, the alternative leather is just as comfortable. The heel height is 1.7 inches tall, and the sole follows the foot's natural arch, so walking doesn’t feel awkward. The bottom also features a non-slip rubber making it easy to maneuver over slippery surfaces. Some have noted, however, that because it isn’t really leather, the boot tends to scuff easily, so wear it with care.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 6–11 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 6 | <strong>Material:</strong> Synthetic leather | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 1.7 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-r13-single-stack-chelsea-boots-single-stack-chelsea-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>R13 Single Stack Chelsea Boots Single Stack Chelsea Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="R13 Single Stack Chelsea Boots Single Stack Chelsea Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3qvjTULRtpcIav60vGnjKbZnDCY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/r13--single-stack-chelsea-boots-single-stack-chelsea-boots-4419f36e30c14dc8857e8f98f8487f29.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> From the worn finish to the exposed back zipper, these boots are loaded with personality.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It could take a few days to break into the leather.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re ready to make the world your stomping ground, you’re ready to wear these awe-striking boots. The soft calfskin leather, which may take a few wears to break in, will only get better with age, and, “the worn-in look gives them a cool, vintage effect,” adds <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Caroline Maguire</a>, Fashion Director at Shopbop.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Though they may seem effortless, every detail of the boot is meticulously thought through: The edgy back zipper detail makes for easy on-and-off styling and the red contrast stitching offers subtle color pop. Do we need a zipper with thick pull tabs? No. But does it make the boot look that much cooler? Absolutely. Plus, the low-stacked heel makes it easy to wear these in a variety of situations and seasons, and it still adds enough heft to elevate the boot’s silhouette.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–12 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Calfskin | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 1.5 inch</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-brown-aeyde-jack-calf></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Brown</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Aeyde Jack Calf</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Aeyde Jack Calf" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/OsPu0gcvaIipJ_FR1gaOTWFIpiU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aeyde--jack-calf-3eb61b6861804aa39da77158ab854952.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Shopbop</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The stunning, glossy leather brown boots boast durable leather and a timeless style.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> There are no half sizes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Wowing us with a rich chestnut colorway, the beautifully constructed Aeyde Jack Calf could be the one boot we wear every day until the end of time. “These are great because they have a slightly higher shaft,” says stylist and author <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Laurel Pantin</a>. “If you like wearing ankle crops in winter, these will fit nicely under your trouser legs, and keep your ankles warm.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Ramping up their versatility, the boots also feature an almost 2-inch heel height, which strikes a happy medium between elevated, fancy footwear you can wear with formal attire or trotting about town.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> EU35–EU42 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 1.8 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-waterproof-bernardo-briton-rain-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Waterproof</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Bernardo Briton Rain Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Bernardo Briton Rainboots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4DDTrsGdB0zE8Qsq4_2pd1v4WEA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/bernardobrittonboot-e9752b395421422d819fbe168326b4ec.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> Still durable and waterproof, your traditional rain boot just got the most adorable upgrade.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The back bow frequently becomes untied.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve owned this pair of Bernardo Rainboots for over five years and not only are they some of the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>best waterproof boots</a> we have, but they still look brand spanking new. The classic almond-shaped toe and slim, curved silhouette haven’t fallen out of style, either, and they remain a staple in our outfit rotation even when we’re facing blue skies. “Coming in four different colorways, the dark green boot has a special color pop that I'd wear with a utility pant tucked in,” Flax says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">One minor, frustrating detail is how we find ourselves frequently having to re-knot the back bow, but on the plus side, the straps aren’t so long they’re left dragging if they do become untied.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 6–11 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5 | <strong>Material:</strong> Synthetic leather | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 1.25 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-blundstone-original-500-chelsea-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Blundstone Original 500 Chelsea Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Zappos Blundstone Original 500 Chelsea Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/O2ivvbyKNTXiPHcshEiv_9U0lF4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Blundstone-Original-500-Chelsea-Boot-69c18f125cf745c79b05b8ff24b91d6d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zappos</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The water-resistant leather will keep your feet warm and dry no matter what wacky weather Old Man Winter brings your way.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The front pull tab, while utilitarian, can feel floppy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Blundstone means business when it comes to the design of these Chelsea boots. (And, really, all of their shoes.) They’re built to last no matter what you or Mother Nature put them through, from a walk through the woods to drudging through puddles. They feature double stitching, serious shock absorption (as in, the boots will absorb 90 percent of the impact of each step you take), thick water-resistant leather, and a tough outsole that can be put through the wringer. If you live in a wet climate, these could be a stylish<a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1> rain boot</a> option.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">All of those features ensure they’ll still look great at the end of the day — day after day since you’ll be wearing these for years to come, especially since the leather will mold to your feet over time. The front tab is definitely an acquired taste (some people dislike how it flops over), but it makes pulling on your boots so much easier.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–14 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 7 | <strong>Material:</strong> Water-resistant leather | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> Not listed</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-winter-dr-martens-2967-smooth-leather-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Winter</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Martens 2967 Smooth Leather Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Martens 2967 Smooth Leather Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BqA-J-WXLHp3AnVqxuvD2Jj1Lzc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-martens--2967-smooth-leather-boots-0f2e4f2234714d39bf608dd36b1aa399.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Martens</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> You can wear these forever-in-style boots through the worst of winter and they’ll still look good in spring.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> This pair is sold in full sizes only.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">There’s a reason these Dr. Martens Chelsea boots have been in production since the ‘70s. (If only our mothers kept their pairs from that era, we wouldn’t be shopping for new ones.) They’re worth the buy though because they magically defy the decades and the trends that come and go within them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-31 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If winter hits particularly hard where you live, you’ll not only want these boots but need them, too. The notoriously tough leather will keep your feet dry and warm snowstorm after snowstorm. Then, come springtime, give them a good polish to wash off the road salt. While they’ll feel stiff to start, trust the breaking-in process and know they’ll mold to your feet in no time. They don’t come in half sizes, though, so if you’re between sizes, make sure to size up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5–12 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather upper with rubber sole | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 1.5 inches&nbsp;</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leather-frye-jean-chelsea></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frye Jean Chelsea</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frye Jean Chelsea" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Vq0do-ruh7ZPxZGeejkrjAj_J3M=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/frye--jean-chelsea-86a9a6e043eb46e8b114da6c348d707b.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Neiman Marcus</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The durable leather looks great now and develops a gorgeous patina over time.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> The heel may be too high for everyday wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Offered in four rich, stunning leather and suede colorways and half sizes (a major score for us in-betweeners), we challenge you to find an occasion you can’t wear these stunning leather Chelsea boots. The delicate exposed stitching along the V-shaped elastic sides, the beautifully worn-in leather look, and the almond-shaped toe all lend an elegant Western style that’s anything from kitschy. Although we’re itching to pair some longer <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>flare jeans</a> with the higher block heel and take ‘em, well, everywhere, the height may limit those who prefer their footwear closer to the ground.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size:</strong> 5.5–12 | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 2.6 inches</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-heeled--other-stories-heeled-leather-chelsea-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Heeled</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>& Other Stories Heeled Leather Chelsea Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="&amp;amp; Other Stories Heeled Leather Chelsea Boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/kVUoNxz2T1uN6BmJ35QEf0ufJPc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/-Other-Stories-Heeled-Leather-Chelsea-Boots-9fcd73c6e27b4a739492a8a4bcc3870d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>& Other Stories</p></span><p><strong>What We Love:</strong> The block heel makes walking still comfortable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love:</strong> It doesn’t come in half sizes, and they run large, so finding the perfect fit can be tricky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Let’s collectively take a moment to appreciate how beautiful these heeled Chelsea boots are. The sleek, smooth leather goes uninterrupted from the toe to the calf, where the boot ends in a square toe. The heel lifts you 2.9 inches off the ground, which may sound like a lot, but due to the block nature of the heel, won’t feel all that uncomfortable. You can easily dress this style up or down.

It’s true — between the roomy almond-shaped toe box, supremely soft and stretchy calfskin leather, and cushioned arch support these may as well be orthopedics. And, while the stretch side panels keep the core integrity of a classic Chelsea boot, from there the silhouette has a life of its own, including a 1-inch platform and sleek back zipper to round out the sexy style.

Although the ones she owns aren’t suede, she can speak on the interior and general makeup of the shoe, which is that they are sturdy yet soft. The leather molded around her foot to become a custom fit. She has even worn them in the rain with no water seeping through the seams. The short heel is just enough to curve along the natural arch of the foot, keeping it from feeling strained.

The round toe gives them a softer, more feminine shape and the creamy snow-white colorway adds an understated elegance to the boot. And, the plush cushioned midsole provides ample support to flat arches so you can schlep around all day in the rain and mud, then wipe the smooth leather clean for dinner and drinks.

Leather is a classic, and so is suede, but whatever you choose you’ll likely want it to be weather-resistant. A few questions to ask yourself: Is real leather a must, or is faux okay? What type of less-than-ideal weather will you be wearing these in? If you foresee yourself braving snow and sleet, consider water-resistant leather. Will you need to treat the material before wearing the shoes or at the end of the winter? No matter what you pick, you’ll want something that lasts a long time.</li><li><strong>Heel Height:</strong> There’s no right or wrong heel height for Chelsea boots; it’s all personal preference. As you’re shopping, keep an eye on how tall the heel is to determine if it’s a good fit for your wardrobe and lifestyle. Don’t let a little lift scare you away.&nbsp;</li><li><strong>Fit:</strong> “The Chelsea boot is a tighter fit, originally, it was commissioned by Queen Victoria as an easier riding boot, so it's meant to be easy to pull on, but durable,” says Flax, often goes up a size to best accommodate her wide feet. Pantin agrees, explaining that while you want a snug fit, this everyday shoe should still be roomy enough to accommodate socks.</li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you wear Chelsea boots?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Don’t be afraid to play with the types of bottoms you pair with Chelsea boots: Skirts, wide-leg or cropped are all fair game,” says Flax. For example, she suggests pairing a lug-sole, brightly colored Chelsea boot with an overtly feminine dress for something more formal. And, “For colder weather months, I love a sleek sweater set with a clean classic style and one unique detail like a square toe or taller ankle shaft.”</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since this footwear style is typically low, Pantin doesn’t recommend tucking Chelsea boots into jeans. “I would wear them with cropped kick flares though so that they go up under the opening of the pant and cover your ankles,” she says, adding “They're also cute with midi-length, preppy skirts — ideally with a tiny bit of sock poking out of the top.”<br></p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Are Chelsea boots good for walking?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Part of what makes Chelsea boots so versatile is that they’re great for work and play because they often incorporate functional and stylish design details like lug soles, cushioned insoles, and durable leather.

To show off a hint of leg between your boots and the bottom of your pant leg, opt for ankle socks — ones that stay in place, won’t get annoyingly caught under your heel, and can’t be seen. We’re big fans of a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>visible crew sock</a> though. (Warm ankles, too.) To achieve that look, opt for a taller sock that just sits an inch or two taller than the shaft of your boot.
