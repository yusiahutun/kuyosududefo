The 22-year-old and her friends took to <a href=#>Instagram</a> to share snaps from their night on the town and we got a glimpse of her outfit.</p><p>Wearing her black and red-dyed hair down, she donned a black waistcoat and a lacy black bra which could be seen peaking out from the top.</p><p>She also accessorized by layering a couple of silver-colored necklaces around her neck and matched it with a silver bracelet on one of her wrists and a matching ring. Billie clearly wanted to make sure she looked good at all times, as lipgloss can be seen shining on her lips as she smiles for the camera.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Grammys: Miley Cyrus ‘forgets her underwear’ in front of 20,000 people</a></p><p>The party was held at Fleur Room in West <a href=#>Hollywood</a> and was attended by many famous faces. They included Paris Hilton, <a href=#>Megan Fox</a>, Julia Garner, and Hunter Schafer.</p><p>During the ceremony, she wore two ensembles. On her arrival, she wore her hair down and some glasses. Her clothing was mostly black, with her shoes and trousers having no bright colors. However, to add a pop of color, her jacket had ‘Barbie’ emblazoned in pink and its satin sleeves were light pink. Under the jacket, she had a white shirt on and paired it with a black tie.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-billie-takes-home-the-awards>Billie takes home the awards</h2><p>During her performance, she changed again. As Margot Robbie often did on the press tour, she paid homage to <a href=#>Barbie</a>.</p><p>She was dressed just like one of the iconic dolls from 1965, Poodle Parade Barbie. She wore a sleeveless, knee-high green dress with a pink turtleneck underneath. To keep herself warm, she topped it with a plaid-patterned green and white cardigan. Finishing the look, her shoes were a light green set of heels</p><p>Billie couldn’t quite believe she and her writing partner, brother Finneas, 26, had picked up Song Of The Year.</p><p>In her acceptance speech, she said: “I just want to say everyone in this category, like – that was a crazy list of incredible people, incredible artists, incredible music! I feel crazy right now. Damn, dude. I am shocked out of my balls.”</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> continued: “Thank you to the members of the Recording Academy. Thank you to my brother who is my best friend in the world and makes me the person I am today.”</p><p>When winning Best Song Written For Visual Media, Billie said: “Woah, hi, thank you so much! This is shocking to me. I was expecting to turn right around and leave. Thank you very much to the members of the Recording Academy. I’m just in awe. I feel so grateful every second of my life to be doing everything that I do.</p><p>“This is ridiculous and insane, and every time I’m involved in anything like this I’m just shocked. Thank you to Greta for making the most incredible, the most beautiful, and empowering <a href=#>movie</a>. Thank you to Margot for being so amazing. Making this song saved me a little bit.”</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Zendaya hailed ‘the outfit slayer’ after rocking cut-out two-piece at Dune premiere</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2WGcK7IpaOinV2atq210qFkn5meqHqkrc2tZJuqlZbBqbGMmp6aoZ5irqfAxKtkrJ2Vnruoedaio51loJ28tbvSZp2rp51itLOtzKawrGWRm8GmvoypmKusqWQ%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
