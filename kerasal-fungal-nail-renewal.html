The topical <a href=# id=auto-tag_nail-treatment data-tag=nail-treatment>nail treatment</a> swiftly revives yellow, brittle nails—reviewers claim it works in as fast as two days.

Shocking to find a product that ACTUALLY works,” shared one shopper. “It’s expensive but lasts a long time so I think it’s worth it. It helped the appearance of my nails – they were yellow and had vertical lines and were dry. Seconds after, nails are pink and look fine!”</span></p><p>“After 3-4 days my nails were 80 percent clearer! They look so much better,” said another. “I think part of my results may be due to me applying the Kerasal after my morning and evening bath. The nail is softer and more permeable after a bath (or soaking) is my theory. Nevertheless, it worked for me!”</p>Let’s all listen to these Amazon shoppers and “seriously, <a data-pmc-sp-product=65bf77da5af5400219c672ad4fd299f5 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"buy the product.","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Kerasal Nail Renewal, Restores Appearance of Discolored or Damaged Nails, 0.33 fl oz (Packaging May Vary)","price":"18.84","id":"B007ADOL28","category":"Nail Fungus Treatments"},"id":1367273,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>buy the product.</a> “ <img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/ShoppingNewsletter_onsitegraphic.png alt="StyleCaster Shopping Newsletter Sign Up" width=670 height=315 sizes="(max-width: 670px) 100vw, 670px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWitdFmpZqhnKh8cn%2BVcGlwa1%2BgsrOt0pqjZp6lo7SiuIynmKKkXaeyr7HWmqNo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
