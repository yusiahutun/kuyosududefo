Review Films in a Timely Fashion</h2><p>While there are film lovers of all types on Letterboxd as well as many <a href=#>free websites for movie lovers</a> that are more accommodating to fans of more niche or older films, you're best off reviewing films that have only recently come out on Letterboxd.</p><p>By reviewing films in a timely fashion, you can ensure that you stay involved in the current discussions, giving you the best chance of interacting with others and seeing some engagement on your reviews and comments. With the volume of new movies coming out at all times, it can be a bit overwhelming to keep up with all the latest movies.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Don't worry if you leave a lot of new movies until much later to watch them, but try to keep up with the most popular releases to get more engagement on your reviews.</p><h2 id=interact-with-other-users-rsquo-reviews-and-lists>3. Interact With Other Usersâ€™ Reviews and Lists</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/letterboxd-black-phone-reviews.jpg><p>Interacting with other users' reviews and lists is a great way of ensuring you get more socializing out of the platform. While Letterboxd's core offering is the ability to review your favorite films and create lists, engagement with others is a big part of the platform.</p><p>By interacting with other users' reviews and lists, you are likely to grow on the platform. Growing your profile on Letterboxd may not be your goal for using the platform, but it can bring a lot more fun to the platform.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=upgrade-to-patron>4. Upgrade to Patron</h2><p>Upgrading to Patron does cost money but it brings about a lot of added benefits to your account that can help you get the most out of the platform.</p><p>The cost may put you off. In which case, weighing up whether you'd get any benefit from the features compared to the cost is important. You should also consider how much time you spend on Letterboxd. Generally speaking, if you spend a lot of time on the platform then you're likely to enjoy having the Patron features if the monthly cost is affordable to you.</p><h2 id=post-and-interact-regularly>5. Post and Interact Regularly</h2><p>It may seem to be an obvious one, but you'd be surprised at how little you probably spend on each individual platform that you're signed up to. By spending more time on the platform you're likely to get the most out of Letterboxd.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This doesn't mean you have to spend every waking hour on the app, or even go on it daily if you can't fit it in around your schedule. What it does mean though is that setting some time aside in a way that works for you. During this time, you can log and review your most recent watches, as well as interact with others.</p><h2 id=create-lists-of-the-films-you-watch>6. Create Lists of the Films You Watch</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/letterboxd-best-movies-list.jpg><p>A surprising number of Letterboxd users only log or review films, with many ignoring the list feature. You could create standard Top 10 Lists or maybe even Worst 10 lists. The <a href=#>best sites for creating your own personal movie list</a> all make the process easy, but Letterboxd in particular has a smooth and intuitive UI that makes creating lists fun and stress-free.</p><p>Letterboxd gives you a lot of freedom with the type of list you want to create and makes it really simple.
