Yes. Besides being public about the relationship, Iva’s husband still gets questions about her. Questions such as “who is Mike Colter’s wife?” are common when he is doing interviews to promote films. Happily, the actor has repeatedly cleared the air about his relationship with Iva.</p><h2>5 things you should know about Iva Colter</h2><p class=align-left>Since Iva Colter is soft-spoken and has not appeared in any interviews, there isn’t much information about her in the public domain. However, her husband’s job and the nature of their relationship puts her in the limelight. Some of the things you should know about Iva Colter include:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e59336220232c573.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Shepard Smith's partner? Everything you need to know</span></p></a><h3>1. She met Mike Colter in the early 2000s</h3><p class=align-left>Unlike most celebrities, they met before fame. At the time, they were university students. Mike was pursuing a Master’s degree in acting while she was finishing her PhD in Comparative Literature.</p><p class=align-left>Being first-time students at Rutgers University meant fewer friends for both of them. While Mike and Iva were not pursuing a similar course at the university, their mutual love for arts and film brought them together.</p><p class=align-left>Shortly after university, Mike and Iva started dating. However, unlike Iva, Mike was not getting acting roles as he had expected. According to the actor, Iva gave her moral support as he was trying to find a footing in the competitive acting industry.</p><p class=align-left>Luckily, Mike started getting roles after a few years. Thanks to their newfound stability, they concentrated on their relationship. They officially dated for ten years before formalising their union in 2016.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d062e084a5eb53ad.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who is Gina Carano's husband? Here's everything you should know</span></p></a><h3>2. Iva is unapologetic about her interracial marriage</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e59336220232c573.jpeg><p class=align-left>Mike’s Colter lowest moments on TV are about unplanned discussions about his marriage with Iva. For example, when the actor appeared on <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Wendy Williams Show</a>, the audience was cold when Wendy shared Iva and Mike picture.</p><p class=align-left>While it could be other reasons, many people believe the response was because she is white. Fortunately, Mike has consistently defended her <a href=#>interracial marriage</a>.</p><p class=align-left>Besides their marriage, Iva and Mike are unique from one another. For example, Iva is one-year older than Mike. She was born on April 25, 1975, while the actor was born in 1976. Also, Mike is from South Carolina while she is from New Jersey.</p><p class=align-left>While they have a lot of differences, the couple has stuck together. Some social media users have termed Iva and Mike as an “inseparable couple.”</p><p class=align-left>In addition to their unbreakable love for each other, they are parents. Mike Colter and Iva Colter are parents to two children. They welcomed their firstborn daughter in 2016, shortly after their wedding. Three years later (in 2019), Mike shared the <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">good news</a> with his followers. The announcement on social media was about the birth of his second daughter.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0311672a72bdf410.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Does Jennifer Aniston have kids? Here's what you need to know</span></p></a><h3>3. She has a doctorate</h3><p class=align-left>Mike’s wife has always been passionate about education. Her journey to PhD started in the late 1990s in her 20s. After her undergraduate studies, Iva started looking for a university to enrol in for her <a href=#>Master’s degree</a>. Luckily, she got a spot at Central European University.</p><p class=align-left>Her Master’s degree was in Gender and Culture studies. As part of her curriculum, Iva studied many cultures and how gender was interpreted in each culture. Her background in this study area allowed Iva to work with different organisations as a young graduate.</p><p class=align-left>Later, she enrolled at Rutgers University. The current senior manager at <a href=# title>Netflix</a> pursued a doctorate in Comparative Literature. While she is now in the corporate space, her background gives her a better understanding of Netflix and customers’ relationships.</p><h3>4. She is a department director at Netflix</h3><p class=align-left>After her undergraduate studies, Iva worked in several companies. For example, she was part of the recruiting team at Ares Management Company. She also worked in consultancy before going back to university for PhD studies.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/e50d230d47949560.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=28><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Jennette McCurdy: iCarly star quits acting, says she is ashamed</span></p></a><p class=align-left>After her doctorate, Iva briefly worked as a University professor. She taught English and related courses. Her time at Central European University was impactful to the young Iva for different reasons. From her time as a university professor, Iva mastered the art of working with bigger teams.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/d062e084a5eb53ad.jpeg><p class=align-left>So, what does Iva Colter do now? She is Netflix’s director of Talent Acquisition. Her job description revolves around recruitment. As one of the decision-makers, Iva has brought some talented individuals on board and, therefore, making Netflix home to gifted professionals in the streaming space.</p><p class=align-left>However, she did not start as the director for Talent Acquisition at the streaming company. The first Iva Colter Netflix role was in the sales department. She was part of the managerial team that helped the company capitalise on the growing streaming market, especially in the USA.</p><h3>5. Iva is not active on social media</h3><p class=align-left>Unlike Mike, who has over 500,000 followers across the three major social media platforms, Iva does not have social media accounts. She is one of the few people in the entertainment space that seems unbothered by the fast-growing niche. However, there are probable reasons for her surprising absence on social media.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7aa4be824fcfa2ae.png></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Martie Allen: 10 interesting facts to know about Kristy Mcnichols's partner</span></p></a><p class=align-left>As one of the key managers in the streaming market, her opinions may be misinterpreted as the company’s opinion. In the past five years, many corporate leaders in America have avoided the three major social media platforms for the same reason. Self-censoring is becoming critical for professionals such as Iva.</p><p class=align-left>Besides the nature of her job, Iva’s interracial relationship is another reason she avoids social media. Many mean comments about her relationship (with the TV star) because of their racial identities have been posted online. Therefore, not being on social media shields her from negativity.</p><p class=align-left>While most people know Iva Colter as Mike Colter’s wife, she is a career woman and a mother of two. She has also worked as a university professor before joining Netflix as a director. Even when gossip blogs and news outlets discuss her marriage negatively, Iva continues to be the glue holding her young family together.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/81e53a3fcdacb0a0.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Angelina Jolie and Billy Bob Thornton relationship explained</span></p></a><p class=align-left><a href=#>Tuko.co.ke</a> has created an article covering short bios of the Queen Sugar cast. Queen Sugar is a unique program that focuses on real people coping normally with their lives. Unlike other shows that overhype reality, this show is simple but entertaining.</p><p class=align-left>Among the cast is Rutina Wesley, Dawn-Lyen Gardner, Kofi Siriboe, and Omar J. Dorsey.
