No one has to tell you that she is small, it’s quite crass. So it’s no surprise that the actress is 1.5 meters 1 inch tall, and you can bet that she will rock every inch she has.</p><p>Do you know what would make the height of her Reece Witherspoon even more striking? A big co-star and she had one in the movie Four Christmas 2008. Sources say that her height differences during the shooting caused some challenges, as Reese’s figure shouldn’t be that much shorter than Vince’s. Here’s what the actress had to say about that.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/celebily.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/04/Reese-Witherspoon-Height.jpg><p>‘He’s 6’5″ and I’m 5’2″. We had a really funny scene, I don’t know if it’s in the film anymore, where he rolls over onto me. We were in bed and then at the very end he rolls over and goes to sleep, but he rolls over and lays on top of me.’</p><p>She added: “It was as if a tree trunk had just landed on me. I went on: “Tim-brrr! It was really funny. I was standing on a lot of boxes and they had to build ramps about the size of where I was supposed to be. It was a challenge, especially the kissing scenes. It was hard to get up there to kiss him, but we managed to do it.</p><p>As we are dealing with lists today, here is a short one containing some celebrities who share Reese Witherspoon’s height. Lady Gaga, Vanessa Hudgens, and Nelly Furtado are all as tall as the star.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>Weight</strong></h2><p>The actress has a tough body, none of us here will testify to that, and even after the birth of her babies she still has it. Some would even say she’s better looking than ever. She had her last baby bump in 2012, and after the birth of her second son and her last child in September of the same year, the actress recovered remarkably.</p><p><strong>ALSO READ: <a href=#>Jennifer Lopez Kids, Sisters, Parents, House</a></strong></p><p>You want to know how?

After the retreat, an insider revealed that “Witherspoon was so inspired by her healthy vacation that she took Bryant’s fitness tips to heart.
