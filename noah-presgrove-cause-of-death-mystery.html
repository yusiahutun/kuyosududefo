His death was initially deemed "suspicious" by the Oklahoma State Bureau of Investigation.</p><p>Family members shared with NewsNation that he had a caved-in skull, road rash on his hip, gravel rash on his shoulder and multiple bruises on his body. His teeth were also scattered along the highway.</p><p>Only one of the shoes he was wearing belonged to the victim, with Presgrove's aunt previously telling the outlet one of the teen's friends said he wanted to go for a walk, couldn't find both his shoes and grabbed one belonging to another friend at the bash.

You can see blood seeping through the covering ... As I'm looking at it, it just seems weird," he recalled of the scene. "The placement of the body. The tooth, the shorts [which he claims were allegedly folded beside his body]. It doesn't look like a hit-and-run."</p><p>A friend of Noah's who was at the same party, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>told the outlet</strong></a> he "100%" believes Presgrove was "hit by a semi."
