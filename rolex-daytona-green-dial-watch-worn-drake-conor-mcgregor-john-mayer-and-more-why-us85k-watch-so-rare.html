How Rolex became the top luxury watch brand in the world
For those who can afford high-end timepieces, sports watches are generally the most sought after, especially among millennials.
Rolex has enjoyed an advantage in this area through its historical links with sports like tennis. And while Rolex’s Oyster Perpetual, Submariner and Day-Date models are highly popular, the Daytona, especially the one with a green dial, is one of the most notoriously difficult Rolex models to own."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

At its heart is the Calibre 4130 – a perpetual, self-winding, mechanical chronograph with a precision of -2/+2 seconds per day.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Want to buy a Rolex? 6 of the best places to shop online that you can trust</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Watch nerds will wax lyrical about the calibre’s blue Parachrom hairsprings – the Rolex proprietary parts made from niobium and zirconium that are behind its accuracy thanks to their incredible “memory” and ability to bounce back to their original shape after every movement.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">On the surface, too, it’s only the green dial that differentiates this model from its black- and white-faced counterparts. Just as is the case with other Daytonas, there is a small second hand at six o’clock, a 30-minute counter at three o’clock and a 12-hour counter at nine o’clock.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite having three sub-dials and the (rather long) name of the watch model inscribed at 12 o’clock, the dial doesn’t feel overcrowded.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Amid luxury watch boom, other Swiss brands copy Rolex with pricey models</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Calibre 4130, which was originally released in the year 2000, also offers a power reserve of around 72 hours, which improves on the 50 hours for earlier models.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There have been quite a few iterations of full-gold Daytonas, including those with special dials, but the contrast between this particular watch’s iridescent green dial and the 18-carat gold case makes it especially eye-catching and instantly recognisable from a distance.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The green also adds a playful note to this model that is absent in Daytonas with a black or white dial.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">An appealing feature of all of Rolex’s Daytona models is their 40mm (1.6-inch)-diameter case. This size makes the watches appropriate for both men and women to wear whether at the gym or in a boardroom meeting. In short, Rolex Daytonas are unisex, and rugged and utilitarian enough to be used for sports, yet elegant enough to wear in a formal setting.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In light of all this, the important question is: how does one get one’s hands on a “Gold Hulk Rolex”? Unfortunately, Rolex isn’t telling.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The Swiss watchmaker is one of the most secretive horology brands, to the extent that even company executives are discouraged from doing press interviews.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">There is no confirmed information on the number of Rolex watches produced each year, although experts estimate it to be around 1 million a year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the past, prospective luxury watch buyers tried their luck in the United States and China – the world’s two biggest Swiss watch markets – where supply was previously relatively plentiful. However, in light of such high demand of late, even these countries are no longer promising resources to tap.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">Pre-owned Rolex, Patek Philippe, Audemars Piguet watch prices to fall more</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In Hong Kong, gold Rolexes have traditionally been very popular with businesspeople, not purely for their value as a status symbol, but because in Cantonese “Gold Ro[lex]” sounds like kum lo, a phrase meaning “lasting success”.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">According to a recent report by the Federation of the Swiss Watch Industry, Hong Kong remains the third largest market for Swiss-made watches. But even this distinction, according to retail sources, doesn’t earn the city more than low-single-digit amounts of green-dial Rolex Daytonas arriving for sale each year.</p>Accordingly, <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">the second-hand market</span></a> might be the only chance for impatient collectors with cash to burn to get their hands on this most coveted of Rolex models. One idea would be to keep a keen eye on watch auctions. Alternatively, get on the waiting list of a friendly <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">luxury watch retailer</span></a>, and hope that the watch will arrive on your wrist before you’re too old to appreciate it.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLOiv8eipqdlkpqutsDYaJirrJmYuaZ7kmtnamtpa3yzu8uer2acka7BsLrAZp6rnZWjeqW1wKVksJmkmLVuw86rpWacopa4pnnCqKWoql2isKi%2BxKCmq2WapLWvecyasJ6qXZa7pXnMqKmeZaedxm7B0nFspGWnlsGktIyspmaqkaey</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
