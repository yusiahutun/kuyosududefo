There are actually a few actors who have completely refused to film a scene that included locking lips with a castmate. While their reasons vary from religious beliefs to questionable age differences, these stars have all stood their ground when it came time to get romantic on set.</p><p>Find out why these stars turned down their on-screen smooches…</p><p><strong>1. </strong><a href=#><strong>Denzel Washington</strong></a></p><p>Denzel Washington usually isn't shy about romantic scenes in his films but for his 1993 flick "Pelican Brief," he decided against locking lips with his co-star Julia Roberts. He <a href=#>says</a> the decision was made so as to not offend some moviegoers who had previously taken issue with a proposed interracial relationship with Mimi Rogers in "The Mighty Quinn." Romance scenes were deleted from both films and Denzel decided to be more cautious about his love scenes moving forward.</p><p>"I have taken so much s--- over the years about not kissing Denzel in that film. Don't I have a pulse? Of course I wanted to kiss Denzel. It was his idea to take the damn scenes out," Julia told <a href=#>Newsweek</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:d3a8a440-ca6c-4343-bc98-d9eac0e00423 data-container-ref=toofab:article:139564d9-d967-4fae-92f0-c30286d2631f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/ea/5by4/2020/09/01/ea6fb031414f44ac8939d3abdb751594_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">19 Celebrity Couples Who've Been Married Over 25 Years</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>2. </strong><a href=#><strong>Lindsay Lohan</strong></a></p><p>Back in 2012, Lindsay Lohan was working on "Scary Movie 5" alongside Charlie Sheen when she reportedly decided she wanted to cut all kissing scenes from the flick. According to <a href=#>TMZ</a>, Lindsay wasn't a fan of Charlie's wild partying past. She was supposed to kiss Charlie three times during their bedroom scene but since she refused, filmmakers had to get creative. While they wrote out most of the kissing scenes, in some moments they ended up having to use a body double.</p><p><strong>3. </strong><a href=#><strong>Candace Cameron Bure</strong></a></p><p>Candace Cameron Bure hasn't completely ruled out onscreen kissing just yet but it's no secret that it makes both her and her husband uncomfortable. When Candace's "Fuller House" character was in the middle of a love triangle, she said she was "kind of over" having to kiss two different men. Meanwhile, she has a new love interest in each of her Hallmark movies, which she isn't a big fan of either.</p><p>"Sometimes I'm doing my Hallmark movies and we've got a new guy in each movie. I'm getting more uncomfortable with it the older I'm getting. I'm like, 'I don’t want to keep doing this!'" Candance <a href=#>said</a> during a panel at The Paley Center.</p><p>Meanwhile, Candance's husband doesn't watch anything she films because he's "uncomfortable." She says she respects his boundaries, and noted that he's never tried to stop her from doing her job.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:8010076f-ea48-431b-aa9c-0cf07b1d0cb0 data-container-ref=toofab:article:139564d9-d967-4fae-92f0-c30286d2631f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/29/5by4/2022/03/04/29bac5a8566e41e3b7981affa238c8d5_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Celebrity Names We've Been Mispronouncing For a Long Time</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>4.</strong><a href=#><strong> Kirk Cameron</strong></a></p><p>Candace's brother Kirk has ruled out kissing scenes all together — unless they're with his wife Chelsea Noble. When his role in "Fireproof" involved an onscreen lip lock, the religious actor refused. Instead of writing the scene out of the film, the directors had Chelsea step in as a body double and shot the scene in silhouette so that Kirk could still honor his commitment to his wife.</p><p>"I have a commitment not to kiss any other woman. So when I'm kissing my wife, we're actually husband and wife honoring marriage behind the scenes," Kirk told "<a href=#>Today</a>."</p><p><strong>5. </strong><a href=#><strong>Neal McDonough</strong></a></p><p>Neal McDonough has had some big on-screen moments during his career, but none of them have involved romantic scenes. The religious actor says that he won't kiss his co-stars out of respect for his wife and children.</p><p>"Life is about honoring God and being the best human being you can be and giving praise to God in everything you do. Killing people on screen— that's fake. That's not real. When you're in bed with another woman on screen — guess what? That's real. I don't like that kind of stuff. Especially now with kids, I don't want to have my kids say, 'Hey, Dad, what are you doing with that lady on-screen?'" Neal told <a href=#>Christian Examiner</a>.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:b36feac0-cb44-4fe1-919f-042cd0f8fe0e data-container-ref=toofab:article:139564d9-d967-4fae-92f0-c30286d2631f data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/bb/5by4/2022/05/13/bb97fb25e93a46d5996ea49d75a7ae4e_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">20 Celebrity Kids Who Have Dated Each Other</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p><strong>6.</strong><a href=#><strong> Thandiwe Newton</strong></a></p><p>Thandiwe Newton turned down a kiss with Gerard Butler in their flick "RocknRolla" but her reasoning makes a lot of sense. At the time, Thandiwe says Gerard was very sick and she didn't want to catch whatever he had. Director Guy Richie had to work around it — and he managed to pull it off really well!</p><p>"Gerry was very unwell indeed. So I wouldn't kiss him. Guy had to improvise. I don't know how he coped with those problems but it ended up being one of the most brilliant scenes," Thandiwe <a href=#>reportedly</a> told Bang Showbiz.</p><p><strong>7. Kimberly McCullough</strong></p><p>When Kimberly McCullough was just 14 years old, she was asked to share a "long kiss" with a 22-year-old guest actor on "General Hospital." Kimberly wasn't comfortable with the age gap with the fellow actor — especially after she heard him making "crude remarks" about the scene. When she spoke to the producer, her request to remove the scene was denied but she ended up holding her ground all the way up until filming.</p><p>"When it came time to do the scene, I refused to kiss him. With the director and the crew watching me, I stood my ground. He kissed me on the cheek instead of the 'long kiss' at the end of the scene. Yes, it was a small victory on my part, but I'm sure people called me 'difficult' as a result," Kimberly <a href=#>wrote</a> on her blog.</p><a id=gallery-link-0ffe37de-6b8d-56f6-b16c-e85ac0cff6cc class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:0ffe37de-6b8d-56f6-b16c-e85ac0cff6cc data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:139564d9-d967-4fae-92f0-c30286d2631f data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e1/4by3/2022/05/26/e1c7332f3a5c42d29e1f6632cbb79b8e_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a> <span class="media-credit gallery-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7j25mbGhfbHq0wMCrqmavmKR6s7HFrqqenF2pvG6yyKWkZqOZqMCqusZmqpydnprAcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
