Brides such as Carol can choose a range of locations to exchange vows depending on the size of their guest list. Weddings with over 60 attendees can hire the venue for exclusive use, with up to 130 guests for the ceremony, reception and wedding breakfast and up to 180 guests for the evening party. The venue can also accommodate larger weddings of 121 to 230 seated guests in a marquee.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/dca440e8d5c7-cliveden-house.jpg><p id=ehkU60TzhgdU data-wc=59>The size of the wedding impacts the price, with packages for 8-16 guests costing £510 per adult and £100 per child, while those inviting 30-60 guests would need to shell out £330 per adult and £100 per child.

She looked elegant in a Bardot satin wedding dress with a fitted waist and an A-line skirt, styling her blonde hair in a classic updo, while her partner Steve looked dapper in a black suit with a silver tie. Proving Cliveden offers a very picturesque backdrop, Carol and Steve posed for photos in a majestic archway against the backdrop of winding treetrunks before heading inside where they stood in a wood-panelled room with intricate carvings and vintage carpets.</p><p id=eMv4iCwPvF1Z data-wc=96>Carol previously confessed she<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;planned to wed Steve in secret</a> before "[telling] everyone later."

However, she later clarified they chose an<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;"intimate" wedding</a> with a small guest list. "We had the most perfect day. It was a tiny wedding but so romantic and intimate. A day we will never forget. We are bursting with happiness. It wasn’t a ‘secret’ wedding, just a private one," she wrote.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/18d27b54cbb0-carol-kirkwood-fiance-steve.jpg><p id=eoTdJqPENoDo data-wc=35>Carol was previously married to cricket player<a class=hm-link href=#>&nbsp;Jimmy Kirkwood</a> for 25 years before they got divorced in 2008.

Speaking of the proposal, she told HELLO!: "It was a lovely, sunny day and we had taken a picnic with us, and we were sitting by the river, watching the boats going by. Steve started fidgeting; I turned to say: 'What's wrong?' He was on his knee, and he proposed. At first, I thought he was joking, but he said: 'No no, I really do mean it, Will you marry me?' I said: 'Yes!! Of course!'"</p><p id=eTRqrtwfuVpC data-wc=15><strong>LOOK:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>BBC Breakfast hosts' weddings unearthed: From Naga Munchetty's mishap to Sally Nugent's rare photo</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
