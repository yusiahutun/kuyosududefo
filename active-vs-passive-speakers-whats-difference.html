People usually purchase speakers with a specific purpose in mind but are greeted with an endless selection of different styles, sizes, and prices. If you don't know a lot about audio, this can obviously be intimidating.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If you're buying audio equipment, one of the primary choices that you'll have to make is whether you want active or passive speakers. All speakers fit into one of these categories, and the difference between them isn't always obvious.</p><p>So what are active and passive speakers, and which one is right for you?</p><h2 id=what-are-active-speakers>What Are Active Speakers?</h2><p>An active speaker is a speaker with a built-in amplifier. They are often referred to as powered speakers because they need to be plugged into a socket or battery. They don't need any additional components to produce audio, and you can plug your audio devices into them directly.</p><h2 id=what-are-passive-speakers>What Are Passive Speakers?</h2><p>A passive speaker is a speaker without a built-in amplifier. In order to work, they need to be connected to an amplifier. They are powered by the amplifier and therefore don't need to be plugged in. In order to use passive speakers, you need to connect your audio devices to the amplifier.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=pros-and-cons-of-active-speakers>Pros and Cons of Active Speakers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/06/three-bluetooth-speakers-on-counter.jpg><p>Active speakers are easier to shop for and don't require any audio knowledge to set up properly.</p><h3 id=pro-active-speakers-are-easier-to-set-up>Pro: Active Speakers Are Easier to Set Up</h3><p>Active speakers are significantly easier to set up. You simply connect your audio device, and they work without the need for any other components.</p><h3 id=pro-active-speakers-may-sound-better>Pro: Active Speakers May Sound Better</h3><p>Active speakers don't always sound better than passive, but you know what you are getting when you buy them. The amplifier is built-in and is designed to produce optimal audio quality with the speaker.</p><p>Passive speakers require that you choose your own amplifier. The sound quality depends on your ability to choose a speaker and amplifier that are suitable for each other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=pro-active-speakers-use-less-space>Pro: Active Speakers Use Less Space</h3><p>Active speakers are heavier than passive because they have an amplifier built-in. But the built-in amplifier also means that they take up less space overall. This makes active speakers ideal if you <a href=#>want something portable</a> or simply don't have much space available.</p><h3 id=pro-active-speakers-have-wi-fi-and-bluetooth>Pro: Active Speakers Have Wi-Fi and Bluetooth</h3><p>Active speakers are often equipped with Wi-Fi and Bluetooth for <a href=#>wireless audio playback</a>. Passive speakers can be used for wireless playback but only if connected to an amplifier with that functionality.</p><h3 id=con-active-speakers-are-more-expensive>Con: Active Speakers Are More Expensive</h3><p>Active speakers are usually more expensive. It's important to note, however, that passive speakers, while cheaper, do require you to purchase a separate amplifier.</p><h3 id=con-active-speakers-cannot-be-upgraded>Con: Active Speakers Cannot Be Upgraded</h3><p>Active speakers are limited in terms of customization and upgrades. The amplifier cannot be replaced if you want something more powerful.</p><h2 id=pros-and-cons-of-passive-speakers>Pros and Cons of Passive Speakers</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2021/05/speakers-2541698.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Passive speakers provide additional customization, but you need to understand what you are buying.</p><h3 id=pro-passive-speakers-allow-you-to-choose-the-amplifier>Pro: Passive Speakers Allow You to Choose the Amplifier</h3><p>Passive speakers allow you to choose your own amplifier. Provided you are comfortable doing so, a passive speaker provides more options in terms of sound quality. You can also experiment with different components until you find a combination that you like.</p><h3 id=pro-passive-speakers-are-easy-to-upgrade>Pro: Passive Speakers Are Easy to Upgrade</h3><p>Passive speaker systems are easier to upgrade. If you want to replace the amplifier or add a component, you can do so without replacing your speakers. Passive speaker systems are easier to repair for the same reason. If the amplifier isn't working, you can fix it or replace it. If the amplifier in an active speaker breaks, you may need to replace the entire speaker.</p><h3 id=pro-passive-speakers-are-available-in-more-sizes>Pro: Passive Speakers Are Available in More Sizes</h3><p>Passive speakers are available in a wider selection of different shapes and sizes. You can also add as many as you want to a single system. This is compared to active speakers designed to work independently and cannot be combined.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=pro-passive-speakers-don-39-t-need-to-be-plugged-in>Pro: Passive Speakers Don't Need to Be Plugged In</h3><p>Passive speakers are powered by the amplifier and therefore don't need to be plugged into an outlet. This allows you to create a speaker system with fewer wires overall.</p><p>Active speakers require one wire going to the audio source (unless wireless) and one wire going to the power source. Passive speakers get both power and audio from the same wire. There is also no requirement to keep passive speakers next to a plug socket.</p><h3 id=con-passive-speakers-require-audio-knowledge>Con: Passive Speakers Require Audio Knowledge</h3><p>If you don't understand audio equipment, you may not get the best performance out of passive speakers. The audio quality of passive speakers is highly dependent on what amplifier you use and how the system is set up.</p><h3 id=con-passive-speakers-are-not-portable>Con: Passive Speakers Are Not Portable</h3><p>Passive speakers cannot do anything unless connected to an amplifier. This makes them completely unsuitable if you want something portable.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=active-vs-passive-speakers-which-one-is-right-for-you>Active vs. Passive Speakers: Which One Is Right for You?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/best-tower-speakers.jpg><p>Active speakers are ideal if you want something that's easy to set up and doesn't require any additional components. Because the amplifier is built-in, you know that everything is already set up to produce optimal sound. Active speakers are also popular for any purpose where portability is important.</p><p>Passive speakers provide more options and allow you to customize your sound system. If you want a specific type of amplifier, or you want the option to upgrade, passive speakers make more sense. Because they don't need to be plugged in, they also provide additional options regarding where you put them.</p><h2 id=active-and-passive-speakers-often-sound-identical>Active and Passive Speakers Often Sound Identical</h2><p>Active and passive speakers are often suitable for the same purpose. While getting the most out of passive speakers requires an understanding of audio equipment, neither option necessarily produces better audio than the other.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>Both types of speaker are popular in home audio systems, and the right one for you, therefore, depends largely on personal preference. Active speakers are the easiest to shop for and install, but passive speakers allow you to choose your own amplifier.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGiYnKyZq7JuwtJmp5qro57DpnnSqZyao5WnwG7Dx5qrrGWUnrOnsdGepZydXw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
