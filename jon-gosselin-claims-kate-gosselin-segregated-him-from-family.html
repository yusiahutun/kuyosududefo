"It was Kate and the kids and that was it. She doesn't talk to her own family so she tried to segregate me from mine until I woke up one day."</p><p>The TLC alum -- who revealed his secret two-year romance with girlfriend Stephanie Lebo, 35, during the interview -- added, "Now I call my mom every day and I call Steph’s mom every day."</p><p>"It just makes my family dynamic much easier," he said. "I didn't have that so much in previous relationships, especially with Kate. Hell no."</p><p>Jon went on to note that he's on "good terms" with "all" his exes -- except for his ex-wife.</p><p>"People might see what's going on between me and Kate over the past few years and think I am the difficult character," he told The Sun, "but I'm actually on good terms with all my exes -- Kate is the only one I don't speak to."</p><p>Waiting for your permission to load the Instagram Media.</p><p>"Colleen and I just decided we weren’t right for each other, but we still talk and we are on good terms," he added, referring to his ex-girlfriend Collen Conrad. "I talk to other exes."</p><p>Jon shares 19-year-old sextuplets -- sons Aaden, Collin, and Joel, and daughters Alexis, Hannah, and Leah -- and 22-year-old twins, Cara and Mady, with Kate. Jon and Kate, 48, were married for 10 years, before divorcing in 2009.</p><p>The Gosselins recently made headlines after Collin and Hannah Gosselin <a href=#><strong>spoke out about </strong></a>their alleged experience living with their mom following their parents split on VICE's docuseries Dark Side of the 2000s.</p><p>When Collin was just 12 back in 2016, his mother <a href=#><strong>said he had "special needs"</strong></a> and sent him to a live-in learning facility. In the doc, the 19-year-old -- who has been <a href=#><strong>the most outspoken sibling </strong></a>when it comes to his family -- called out his mom for putting him facility and accused her of treating him unfairly as a child. Although he admitted he wasn't a "perfect child," he said his "misbehaving was no different" than his siblings. He said he believes that since Kate "was going through a lot of things" at the time, she unfairly took it out on him.</p><p>"I mean, a divorce and plenty of different things that can't be easy to go through," Collin added. "And, you know, I want to think that she needed someone to take out her anger and frustration on, and it was just kind of me. I was in the way, and I was there. So, she chose me."</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:6b6db6c6-fdd3-4c1f-8bc1-b856e73900ab data-container-ref=toofab:article:44b73aa7-fad6-44f3-b6ba-743d4a4bd4c5 data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/e6/5by4/2023/07/10/e68cb771e94e479c8f1cd84ed4ef8ee7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">VICE/Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">Collin Gosselin Says Mom Kate Would Take Out Her 'Anger and Frustration' on Him</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Collin was pulled out of the institution and moved in with his father in 2018, after Jon got sole custody of the teen; Hannah was the only other of the ex-couple's eight children who also moved in with him. The other four sextuplets -- Aaden, Joel, Alexis and Leah -- lived with their mother. The older 22-year-old twins -- Cara and Madelyn -- graduated college this year.</p><p>Following Collin's tell-all interview, Kate came forward to share her truth -- claiming Collin was "unpredictable" and often had "violent" outbursts that still continue to this day.</p><p>"My son Collin, whom I love with all my heart, has received multiple psychiatric diagnoses over the years. For the safety of myself, his brothers and sisters and for his own well-being, he was placed in a facility following years of outpatient treatment which proved insufficient for his needs," she wrote in a statement.</p><p>She continued, "Unfortunately, I believe Collin remains a very troubled young man who continues to need a lot of help. His brothers and sisters and I have not been directly involved in his life due to his history of unpredictable behavior and violent tendencies towards us."</p><p>In response, Jon called Kate's statement "false accusations" and claimed that after years of not seeing her son, she was still "unable to control her abusive words towards him."</p><a id=gallery-link-4ac64912-74fc-4abe-a076-d7fc83547a0a class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:4ac64912-74fc-4abe-a076-d7fc83547a0a data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:44b73aa7-fad6-44f3-b6ba-743d4a4bd4c5 data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/b6/4by3/2023/06/30/b66a5ffc148146b49ac929582641edc7_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3FmaWtfn7yvecaoqqydnJ67bq%2FLmqCmq12grrWxjKCmrKuVobavedKenqudl5bBprCMoaCmZZanvK55xZqkoqSpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
