He's introducing fans to a more humorous side with "When It Rains It Pours," a more uptempo, lighthearted song that turns the old woe-is-me phrase on its ear with a savvy twist.</p><p>The song is actually about a lucky streak that kicks off when an angry girlfriend decides she's had enough.</p><p>"I was caller number 5 on a radio station, won a 4-day, 3-night, beach vacation / Deep sea, senorita, fishing down in Panama / And I ain't gotta see my ex-future mother-in-law anymore / Oh lord, when it rains it pours," Combs sings in the chorus.</p><p>The song's put-the-top-down-and-hit-the-open-road feel and infectious humor will brighten even the darkest mood, and Combs' rough-and-ready vocal performance, paired with a melody that instantly embeds in the listener's head, make "When It Rains It Pours" a track that will have fans singing along without even realizing it. It's not hard to predict it'll be a summertime smash for Combs, who is rapidly becoming one of country music's most interesting young artists to watch.</p><p><strong>Did You Know?</strong> Combs didn't even pick up a guitar until six years ago, when he was 20 years old.</p><p><strong>Listen to Luke Combs, "When It Rains It Pours"</strong></p><p><strong>Brantley Gilbert Reveals Why He Always Beats Luke Combs at Madden NFL</strong></p><p><h3>Luke Combs's "When It Rains it Pours" Lyrics:</h3></p><p>Sunday morning, man, she woke up fighting mad / Bitching and moaning on and on 'bout the time I had / And by Tuesday, you could say that girl was good as gone / Then when Thursday came around, I was all alone / So I went for a drive to clear my mind, ended up at a Shell on I-65</p><p>Then I won a hundred bucks on a scratch off ticket / Bought two twelve packs and a tank of gas with it / She swore they were a waste of time, oh, but she was wrong / I was caller number 5 on a radio station, won a 4-day, 3-night, beach vacation / Deep sea senorita fishing down in Panama / And I ain't gotta see my ex-future mother-in-law anymore / Oh lord, when it rains it pours</p><p>Now she was sure real quick to up and apologize / When she heard about my newfound luck on that FM dial / And it's crazy how lately now it just seems to come in waves / What I thought was gonna be the death of me was my saving grace / It's got me thinking that her leaving is the only logical reason</p><p>That I got the last spot in the Hooter's parking lot / And the waitress left her number on my check with a heart / She picked up on the first ring when I gave her a call / And I only spent five bucks at the Moose Club Raffle / Won a used four-wheeler and three free passes / For me and two of my buddies to play a round of golf / And I ain't gotta see my ex-future mother-in-law anymore / Oh lord, when it rains it pours</p><p>Well I've been on one hell of a redneck road for three weeks now / And it all started on the day that she walked out</p><p><strong>See the Top 10 Songs of 2017 (So Far)</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpa2bmnqku8ybqmavmJq7brXTZqmaoZ6oeqrAjKmmrqqjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
