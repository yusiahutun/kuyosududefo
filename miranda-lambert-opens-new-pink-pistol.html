She decided to <a href=#>close</a> the Pink Pistol, <a href=#>selling the property</a> to her ex-husband, who is reportedly developing something of his own in the space. She decided to re-open in her own hometown. The new location also encompasses Lambert's Red 55 Winery.</p><p>The new Pink Pistol is located in a new development in Lindale called the Cannery, which the city invested in to help jump start local business. The Cannery will eventually also house more&nbsp;retail, restaurants of all types, indoor and outdoor music stages and loft-style apartments. An adjacent park will feature&nbsp;a disk golf course, and further down the road, a dog park and a splash pad.</p><p>“Lightning can strike twice,” Bev Lambert tells the Morning Telegraph. “Just opening a store was never Miranda’s dream. Her whole point all along was to revitalize something. That’s what we’re working toward.”</p><p><strong>See Miranda Lambert's Hairstyles Through the Years</strong></p><p><strong>Watch 9 Unforgettable Miranda Lambert Moments</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmpqGilrulrYylmKaalafBbrvPnqWsZZ6axG68yKeiZqiZqMGwuI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
