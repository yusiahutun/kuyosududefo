Newspaper reports at the time claimed the Spanish government paid Paesa up to £1m for luring his former friend to Bangkok.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>In 1998 Paesa's sister published a death notice in a Spanish newspaper. It claimed her brother had died of a heart attack and been cremated in Thailand. His family asked the Dominican monks at San Pedro de Cardeña, near Burgos, to pray for his soul.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>But when none of his family turned up to hear the monks say mass for him, suspicions were raised about whether he was really dead.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>About £4m had disappeared from his bank account in Madrid a few months earlier.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>It was not until 2004, however, that rumours surfaced that Paesa was alive and well and living under a false name in Luxembourg.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Smudgy photographs taken by private detectives working for clients who claimed that Paesa, now known as Francisco Pando, had ripped them off were published by El Mundo newspaper.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>By then Paesa was reportedly claiming to be Argentine and had a young, blonde girlfriend and a passport that took 14 years off his real age of 68.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>When a judge ruled that the money-laundering charges he faced in connection with the Roldán case had timed out, he was able to live openly again.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Rather than enjoying a quiet and opulent retirement in Luxembourg, however, he appears to have returned to a life of high-risk adventure and strange cross-frontier transactions.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Paesa travelled to Sierra Leone "representing a French lawyer to verify a cargo of antiques, including old perfume bottles and Chinese golden masks", according to the Cadena Ser radio network. He got into trouble with border guards, who detained him, then turned for help to Spanish officials. He was flown out of Sierra Leone with the aid of the Spanish foreign ministry to France where he was released without charges.</p><p class=dcr-1lpi6p1>Spanish diplomatic sources said they believed he was really involved in a major gold transaction.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tbTEoKyaqpSerq96wqikaK%2Bfp7mle5FpaGpnnqTDcH6YaKqpmZ6ewKl50q6nnqqjpcZustGapZyho6R6sa3ErJg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
