Reading a statement with three of her children, Randy, Janet and Rebbie, seated next to her in Arizona, Katherine quickly denied claims she had been kidnapped.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/15/513c1bea-9771-45af-be38-f0efe85a81e3_1e39fffe.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“There are rumours going around about me that I have been kidnapped and held against my will,” she said. “I am here today to let everybody to know that I am fine.”</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“My children would never do a thing to me like that, holding me against my will. It’s very stupid for people to think that,” she added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Soon after, all hell broke loose when the family came face to face. In the security footage, it appears that Janet was trying to grab Paris’ phone from her hand in a driveway. After Paris pulls away and runs into the nearby house, Janet’s security is seen briefly holding her back.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">To add fuel to the fire, police confirmed they were phoned to break up a fight at the property that same day because of an altercation regarding Michael’s will.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At the time, Sandra Ribera, a lawyer for Katherine Jackson, described the scene as “chaos”, and also confirmed that Janet grabbed Paris’ phone. Neither of the ladies have ever addressed the scandal.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The Billboards awards “no-show”</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/15/f9105183-b6e7-419c-acc4-c75fa662185e_7390c88c.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In 2018, Janet was accused of snubbing her famous niece when she was honoured with the Icon award at the Billboard Music Awards.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paris’s grandmother Katherine, brother Prince and aunt Rebbie were there to support Janet as she accepted her award, so social media instantly started speculating why Paris was a no-show.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/15/ae8a68c0-53c8-47d1-8f7e-b5fe173fcf07_595de0ff.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paris immediately hit back, claiming she was never invited and had no idea the family were gathering for the event. “No one from my mgmt [management] reached out to me about attending Billboards or about the award, and no one from my family did either,” she said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">She cryptically added, “It is no one’s business but ours.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/15/2995362c-4c83-43bf-8db8-37736e02df67_2a932007.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Paris also used the opportunity to reach out to Janet, posting a photo of them together on her Instagram stories and congratulating her on the award.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Topic class="css-1wyvcgo e1b1x8aa3"></span><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-Title class="css-i31uou e1b1x8aa1">Inside Matt Damon’s former LA mansion, just sold for millions</span></p></a></h3><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The alleged funeral bust up</strong></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/15/67e4acfa-fa0d-4c3b-81af-2c79b60c8f9e_0bb8d9e0.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After the death of family stalwart Joe Jackson in 2019, rumours of bad blood between Janet and Paris made headlines again when tabloids reported that they were arguing over who will pay for funeral arrangements.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“Janet has said she’ll pay for it because she believes Paris paying for it would be an embarrassment to the family,” an unknown insider told Radar Online.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/d8/images/canvas/2021/10/15/c1e675cf-1670-4dca-a77f-96d43597d958_8dd37ab6.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">It was claimed some of the tension stemmed from how the two viewed the family patriarch. “Paris believes her grandpa is a legend and should be treated as such,” the source said. Meanwhile, Janet “still had a terrible relationship with him, though it wasn’t shown in public”, a different source told Radar.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">However, Paris took to social media to shut down the story, claiming: “Janet and I haven’t argued in over six years, stop with these stupid rumours.
