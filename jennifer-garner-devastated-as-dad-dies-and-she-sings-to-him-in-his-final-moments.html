We were with him, singing Amazing Grace as he left us (did we carry him across or scare him away— valid question.) While there is no tragedy in the death of an 85 year old man who lived a healthy, wonderful life, I know grief is unavoidable, waiting around unexpected corners.</p><p>“Today is for gratitude.</p><p>“We are grateful for Dad’s gentle demeanor and quiet strength. For how he teased with a mischievous smile, and for the way he invented the role of all in, ever patient girl dad. We are grateful for his work ethic, leadership and faith.”</p><p>She added: “There is so much to say about my dad— my sisters and I will never be done talking about how wonderful he was, so bear with us— but for today I share these memories with my appreciation for the kind and brilliant man, father, and grandfather he was, as well as the loving legacy he left behind.”</p><p>Jennifer Garner also thanked medical teams who helped her dad in recent times.</p><p>She said: “We extend our gratitude to the medical communities of Charleston Area Medical Center and City of Hope. Your care extended Dad’s life and gave him time to be in his favorite spots— surrounded by daughters and grandchildren, cheering for his beloved Aggies, captaining a boat, and— most of all—next to his wife of 59 years, our Mom.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-her-dad-was-so-proud-of-her-he-even-took-part-in-an-advert>Her dad was so proud of her – he even took part in an advert</h2><p>The duo also appeared in a Capital One advert, and she shared a clip of the commercial in the collage.</p><p>In the video, Jennifer Garner says: “When I first started working with Capital One, my dad called them up and asked for the Jennifer Garner card, which is such a dad thing to do,” she&nbsp;says.</p><p>She then explains the phone operator jokingly asks if they’re related because they have the same surname: “He was so proud to tell her, ‘As a matter of fact, she is my middle daughter.'”</p><p>Bill Garner pops into the frame and asks to say the iconic tagline of the credit card, and she says sure.</p><p>He adds: “What’s in your wallet?</p><p>Then Jennifer Garner hugged him and said: “That was good, dad!”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-celebrity-pals-send-her-love>Celebrity pals send her love</h2><p>Fans as well as star-studded friends have paid tribute and sent love to the <a href=#>Hollywood</a> star.</p><p>Reese Witherspoon wrote: “My sweet friend … sending you all my angels to help carry him home. 🕊️”</p><p>The Help’s Octavia Spencer said: “Praying for you and your family, losing a loved one is never easy.”</p><p>Pitch Perfect’s Elizabeth Banks added: “Sending light and love your way.
