Future models may be able to measure blood sugar levels, blood pressure and blood alcohol, according to some revelations from one of Apple’s suppliers. But it’s unknown whether all those features will be available in the Apple Watch 7, expected to be revealed this autumn.
That’s because British company Rockley Photonics, which makes sensors for wearables, doesn’t expect to deliver the silicon photonics chipsets needed for those health monitoring features until the first half of 2022, it said."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Media at the time covered it as a luxury item – there was a model priced at US$17,000. In recent years, Apple has pivoted its marketing and pushed the Watch as a health and fitness device, with key features such as fall detection and electrocardiogram sensors.</p>The <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Apple Watch 6</span></a> currently can read blood oxygen levels, check your heart rhythm, and heart rate. And the latest Samsung Galaxy smartwatches, the Galaxy Watch3 and Galaxy Watch Active2, can monitor your blood pressure, once calibrated with a traditional blood pressure measuring cuff.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Apple has been working on blood glucose tracking for several years, with chief executive Tim Cook testing a device back in 2017.

And the wearables, home and accessories category has been a hit for Apple with sales up 24 per cent to US$7.8 billion in the first quarter of 2021, after a record fourth quarter 2020 when sales rose 20 per cent to US$13 billion.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">“I still think we’re in the early innings on the watch,” Cook said last week. “This is a long way from being a mature market.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuaqyxKyrsqSVZLSisMaeq6xnkafBqq%2FLnmZsaWNnf3V%2FjpqnqaSVYsSiwMKhZKannp7BsL6Mm6Oop5RivbOx0qysq51dl7mwu8Nmqq6fkad6orrDZpilm5%2BdvK15y56tnqSj</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
