For those possessing sensitive, irritated scalp and thin hair, investing in a shampoo that features a gentle and mild formula is deemed as a wise decision. Likewise, for those with oily scalps, relying on a clarifying shampoo can be beneficial.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Ingredient</strong>s: Always pay heed to the list of ingredients. It is wise to invest in an unscented shampoo that is enriched with natural ingredients, essential nutrients, botanical extracts, vitamins, proteins, antioxidants, and coconut-based cleansing agents. Avoid purchasing shampoos that contain artificial fragrances, harsh chemicals, synthetic ingredients, toxins, parabens, silicones, alcohol, and sulfates to avoid any allergic reaction.</p><p><strong>Formula</strong>: The next important aspect is the formulation of the shampoo. It is advisable to splurge on a non-comedogenic, vegan, cruelty-free, and hypoallergenic shampoo to keep scalp irritation, redness, and itchiness at bay.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Texture</strong>: The texture and consistency of the shampoo should neither be too thick nor too runny. It is advisable to choose a shampoo that has a medium gel-like or creamy texture that lathers well. Stay away from shampoos with very thick consistency as they might leave a residue behind or demand rigorous rinsing and cleansing.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>After taking note of the aspects mentioned above, allow us to acquaint you with the benefits of using a fragrance-free shampoo.</p><p><h2 class=title>Benefits of Using Fragrance-free Shampoo</h2></p><p>The following are the benefits of using a top-notch fragrance-free shampoo -</p><li>A fragrance-free shampoo reduces the possibility of rashes, irritation, redness, and scalp buildup.&nbsp;</li><li>It contains less aggressive cleansing agents that protect the natural oils of your hair.&nbsp;</li><li>It causes zero damage to hair and scalp despite repeated shampooing.&nbsp;</li><li>It is safe for sensitive, color, and chemically-treated hair.&nbsp;</li><li>It boosts shine and adds volume without hampering the quality of your hair.</li><p>That was all about the best fragrance-free shampoos that you should think of snagging right away.
