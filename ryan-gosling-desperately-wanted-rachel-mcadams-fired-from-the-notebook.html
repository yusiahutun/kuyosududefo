The pair were at each other’s throats during filming and clashed a lot.</p><p>It actually got quite heated, where Ryan asked for another actress to step in. Not only that, but he said it in front of more than 150 people.</p><p>“Maybe I’m not supposed to tell this story,” Nick said, “but they were really not getting along one day on set. Really not.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong> <a href=#>Tom Holland and Zendaya’s adorable PDA restores our faith in romance</a></p><p>“And Ryan came to me, and there’s 150 people standing in this big scene, and he says, “Nick come here.” And he’s doing a scene with Rachel and he says, “Would you take her out of here and bring in another actress to read off camera with me?” I said, “What?”</p><p>“He says, “I can’t. I can’t do it with her. I’m just not getting anything from this.”</p><p>He continued: “We went into a room with a producer; they started screaming and yelling at each other. I walked out. At that point, I was smoking cigarettes. I smoked a cigarette and everybody came out like, “All right, let’s do this.” And it got better after that, you know?</p><p>“They had it out… I think Ryan respected her for standing up for her character and Rachel was happy to get that out in the open. The rest of the film wasn’t smooth sailing, but it was smoother sailing.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-enemies-to-lovers>Enemies to lovers</h2><p>Despite the fact they quarreled in onset, the pair eventually ended up dating between 2005 and 2007 after starring in the film together.

It introduced me to one of the great loves of my life. But people do Rachel and me a disservice by assuming we were anything like the people in that movie. Rachel and my love story is a hell of a lot more romantic than that.”</p><p>On their breakup, he said: “The only thing I remember is we both went down swingin’, and we called it a draw.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-rachel-was-almost-never-in-the-notebook-and-it-had-nothing-to-do-with-ryan>Rachel was almost never in The Notebook, and it had nothing to do with Ryan</h2><p>There were a few actresses in the running to play Allie, and when it got down to the last two, it was between Rachel and <a href=#>Britney Spears</a>.</p><p>Ahead of her now best-selling memoir, the 41-year-old’s <a href=#>audition was released to the public</a>.</p><p>In her tape, the <a href=#>music</a> star can be seen sobbing as she plays a distraught Allie, telling Noah that the two can’t be together.</p><p><strong>MORE:</strong><a href=#> Tragedy as ‘special’ star who worked on Euphoria dies suddenly at age 44</a></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmppX2aEcL7YmqVmn5%2Bouaq6xmabnqugmr%2BiwMSlsGavkaPBprCMq5icoJWheq6vwJ2Ypqtdm7azscNmnaunnWLBqbGMp6atnZKkvKx7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
