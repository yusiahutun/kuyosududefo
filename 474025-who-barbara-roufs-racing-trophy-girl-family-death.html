She owned a beauty salon in Clovis for 50 years and was the organist for the Church of the Nazarene, Calvary Bible (Bullard), Baptist Valley Bible, and Grace Baptist Church. Unfortunately, her mother died in 2005, years after Barbara Roufs’ death.</p><p class=align-left>Her father rode motorcycles and raced at the Kearney Bowl. He loved fishing and owned a houseboat on McClure Lake, where he vacationed with his <a href=#>family</a>. Barbara’s parents were the first couple to get inducted into the Clovis Hall of Fame.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7b9b5e16cd0ec902.png><p class=align-left>Barbara grew up in California, where she experienced her childhood. After completing her studies, she found an interest in drag racing. But instead of being a <a href=#>race driver</a>, she became a trophy girl.</p><h2>Professional career</h2><p class=align-left>Barbara worked as a drag racing trophy girl in the late 1960s and early 1970s. She was the queen of the 6th annual U.S. Professional Dragster Championship at Orange County International Raceway.

Thus, it was not uncommon to see Barbara’s figure in branded t-shirts and ad magazines. Many people credited her for bringing life to the drag races.</p><p class=align-left>She was instrumental in a time when the drag racing competition evolved in the 1970s from the golden ages of the 60s.

After uploading the photo, Jet, Barbara’s daughter, posted a comment <a href=#>paying tribute</a> to her mother. She explained that her mother was well known and loved.</p><p class=align-left>Although she was surprised to see her photos published on the internet, she said her mother would be proud to see them because they depicted some of her best moments in life and happiest days. Jet also confirmed that her mother had died in January 1991.</p><p class=align-left>The cause of death was sui*cide. However, the reason for committing sui*cide was not apparent. She was 47 when she died.
