My mom taught me everything I know," says Hilton, who has her own skincare line called Pro D.N.A.. The heiress and entrepreneur uses a mix of her own skincare products—a cleanser, eye cream, and moisturizer—with serums from Dr. Barbara Sturm and her go-to facialist Angela Nice.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But Hilton doesn't just rely on skincare products to keep her skin in check. She loves to incorporate tools in her routine, from a FOREO eye massager to an LED mask from Dr. Dennis Gross. But her holy grail device is a gigantic LED LightStim machine that she bought after seeing it in a professional's office. "I love having this as part of my skincare routine because it really just makes all the products go into your skin. I've had this for four years now and I love it, I really see a huge difference," she says. "This is the type that you would have at a professional facialist office and that's where I found it. I said I need one for my house." The machine costs over $2,000—and takes up a whole chunk of bathroom real estate.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Watch the rest of Hilton's 12-step nightly skincare routine, including a lip mask and her signature Unicorn Mist above.</p><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk11"></span><h5 class="css-13733z5 e1jtuqk13">The 50 Craziest, Most Cringe-Worthy Outfits Celebrities Wore In The Early 2000s</h5><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 e1jtuqk10"></span><img alt="Clothing, Jeans, Denim, Fashion, Headgear, Leg, Abdomen, Outerwear, Textile, Hat, " src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hbz-2000s-moments-2001-gettyimages-76209296-1503002692.jpg title="Clothing, Jeans, Denim, Fashion, Headgear, Leg, Abdomen, Outerwear, Textile, Hat, " width=1757 height=3000 decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center>Open Gallery<span class="css-1w4f7je es31yw60"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/arrow-right.7440adc.svg alt title="Black right arrow" width=100% height=auto decoding=async role=img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfl7KiwdOyZqyjmaN6pK3Rnmaaamhuf3d9j2tmqZminsButMilq6imXai4qrrCmqmeZaCnvKXBwq2qZqqfqsGqusRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
