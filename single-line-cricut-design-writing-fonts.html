This means any text you choose will be cut out around the outer path of each letter. If you go to the <strong>Operation </strong>dropdown menu, select any setting under <strong>Draw</strong>, such as <strong>Pen</strong> or <strong>Foil</strong>, to enable you to draw or write your letters rather than cutting them.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/06/cricut-pen-bubble.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The default for text is to draw along the cut marks, resulting in “bubble” lettering rather than single-line drawn letters. You can still draw or foil text in this way, but if you want a professional and sleek result, you’ll want a monoline text.</p><h2 id=15-single-line-writing-fonts-for-cricut-design-space>15 Single-Line Writing Fonts for Cricut Design Space</h2><p>A <a href=#>Cricut machine is a fantastic tool</a>, and you can use a multitude of fonts in your Cricut designs. While Cricut Design Space flaunts its own font library—both free and paid-for—you can also find typefaces in other places, like Google Fonts, Creative Fabrica, and DaFont to name a few. We’ve compiled fonts that fit the agenda, so you don’t have to search yourself.</p><h2 id=cricut-design-space-fonts>Cricut Design Space Fonts</h2><p>If you subscribe to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cricut Access</a>—the $9.99 per month subscription offered for extra Cricut graphics, projects, and discounts—you’ll be able to get any of these fonts. There are some free ones for anyone without access, too. With a new Cricut machine, you can get your first month of Cricut Access for free.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cricut-font-filters.jpg><p>To search for Cricut fonts, use the filters in the <strong>Text </strong>tool to check boxes for <strong>Writing</strong>, and you can choose to filter by <strong>Free</strong> as well. Then, search the font name. Cricut Access fonts are shown with a small green “a” icon on the font listing. Only Cricut Access subscribers can use these fonts. If your subscription runs out, you’ll lose access to those fonts.</p><h3 id=poker-night-free>1.

It has an aesthetically pleasing nature to it due to the letters being the same width. Great for precise and neat writing. It doesn’t offer anything too fancy, and the text is written all in capitals.</p><h3 id=dtc-fall-and-flair-cricut-access>2. DTC Fall and Flair (Cricut Access)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cricut-fall-and-flair.jpg><p>This font gives slightly Sailor Jerry tattoo vibes with the serif ends on the letters. It has varying height crossbars on its letters, so it’s not a font for the perfectionist in you. This font is written in only capital letters. It has a fun flair to it and would work great for a casual decoration font.</p><h3 id=typewriter-free>3. Typewriter (Free)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/wm/2023/06/cricut-typewriter.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The free Typewriter font is available both as a Regular font and a Writing font.</p><p>While a typewriter style is typically wider than this monoline variation allows for, the font has retained some of the classic style’s features—sharp serif ends on the letters and curled tails on Ts and Rs, for example.</p><h3 id=dtc-shiplap-cricut-access>4. DTC Shiplap (Cricut Access)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cricut-shiplap-font.jpg><p>Shiplap is a fun handwritten monoline font. It offers low crossbars that give a playful and young feel to the letters. Like some other paid-for single-line fonts, this one again only writes in capital letters.</p><p>It has a cute, quirky vibe. It would be great for address labels, invites, or anything smart casual.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h3 id=little-white-lies-free>5. Little White Lies (Free)</h3><p>Little White Lies is another handwritten style. This one is much more playful with circles dotting the I's, varying heights in letters, and quirky X-height across the board. This is a very casual and fun font to use.</p><h3 id=telegram-text-cricut-access>6. Telegram Text (Cricut Access)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/telegram-text-cricut.jpg><p>Telegram Text is a serif font that’s pleasing to the eye. It’s quite formal in looks, but playful in some respects with its rounded serifs ending in little circles. You could find many uses for a text style like this. You can even <a href=#>curve text in Cricut Design Space </a>to add more flair to your text projects.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=creative-fabrica-fonts>Creative Fabrica Fonts</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Creative Fabrica</a> is an online marketplace—which is great for <a href=#>selling your digital design to make a passive income</a>.

The download provides a package of typefaces—two script fonts and two sans serif fonts.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>The cursive font option stands up well by itself as a cursive monoline. This would be great for adding handwritten text to homemade invitations, address labels for wedding invites, or anything you need to add a touch of class to.</p><h3 id=muggsy-sketch-12-00-standalone>8. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Muggsy Sketch</a> ($12.00 Standalone)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/muggsy-creative-fabrica.jpg><p>This unbalanced, quirky font is offered as a single-line or hairline font for easy writing, foiling, or engraving with your Cricut machine. Muggsy Sketch is packaged with two uppercase typefaces, multiple ligatures, and extra characters.</p><h2 id=dafont-fonts>DaFont Fonts</h2><p><a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">DaFont</a> is a great resource for finding a large variety of typefaces.

Weld the letters before making your project to ensure the lines are drawn continuously through the joins.</p><p>This glamorous hand-drawn script font would add style and class to anything you wanted to write with your Cricut.</p><h3 id=cherry-free-for-all-uses>10. <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Cherry</a> (Free For All Uses)</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/cherry-dafont.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>This light monospace typeface is clear and easy to read. Its letters are easily spread out for clear plotting with your Cricut machine.

However, the way the paths are drawn means it will be written as single-line. The lines are simply open bubbles instead of closed paths. The original font was designed for an Asian writing system, but it's easily readable when typing Latin letters.</p><p>This is a fun and unique style that can add some playfulness to any design. The open-ended letters make it different from a typical bubble script.</p><h2 id=expand-your-cricut-designs-using-single-line-writing-fonts>Expand Your Cricut Designs Using Single-Line Writing Fonts</h2><p>While there are plenty of typefaces and fonts you can use for traditional Cricut projects, there are much fewer for using Cricut’s <strong>Draw</strong> option.
