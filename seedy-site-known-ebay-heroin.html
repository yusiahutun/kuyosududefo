He got his online identity "Dread Pirate Roberts" from a character in the film , according to prosecutors.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Prosecutors claim Ulbricht also tried to arrange the murders of at least six people who threatened his multi-million-dollar business. The government doesn't believe any murders were carried out.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Ulbricht is charged separately in federal court in Baltimore for one of those alleged murder-for-hire plots.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pleading not guilty, Ulbricht faces up to life in prison if convicted of the trial's most serious charge, internet drug trafficking.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In his opening statement, Ulbricht's lawyer said his client started Silk Road in 2011 as an "economic experiment" and left after a few months. He said Ulbricht was set up as a "fall guy" for the site's operators.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Der-Yeghiayan said he began the Silk Road investigation as part of his work tracking drug shipments through Chicago's O'Hare International Airport. He told the jury about an online undercover buy of 1,000 ecstasy tablets using Silk Road.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Silk Road required that all transactions be made in bitcoins to keep the buyers' and sellers' identities secret, Der-Yeghiayan testified. Der-Yeghiayan said Silk Road held bitcoin payments in escrow until the buyer received the order and completed the transaction.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said the site had customer-assistance employees who helped moderate disputes between buyers and sellers.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Once a transaction was complete, the sellers could go to a bitcoin exchange and trade the virtual currency anonymously for gold, dollars or another currency, the agent added.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Der-Yeghiayan said he was also an undercover Silk Road site administrator for several months, working 10 to 12 hours a day on an Apple MacBook in exchange for about US$1,000 a week in bitcoins.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He said he had frequent online chats, using the name "cirrus", with Dread Pirate Roberts and other Silk Road employees.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The agent told jurors that Ulbricht was online as Dread Pirate Roberts on his laptop in San Francisco's Glen Park Library on Oct. 1, 2013, corresponding with Der-Yeghiayan as cirrus, who was in a nearby café. Der-Yeghiayan signaled other agents who arrested Ulbricht, taking care to seize his computer before he could log out, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Der-Yeghiayan is expected to conclude his testimony later this week.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">&nbsp;</p><p>This article appeared in the South China Morning Post print edition as: The seedy site known as eBay for heroin</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51ku6bD0miuqKqcmXyivtOimqWdX2aDeXyRbGxoq5Wasbp50qKrnmWbo7y4uoyemZqxXZ2ys7vIpw%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
