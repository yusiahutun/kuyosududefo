Here's what to consider if you're wondering whether 4G or 5G connections are a must-have or something superfluous for your next laptop.</p><p>Before we proceed, two quick reminders:</p><p>First, while both are related to wireless data transfer, there are lots of <a href=#>differences between 5G mobile networks and 5 GHz Wi-Fi connections</a>. Most modern laptops support the latter, but the former is much less common.</p><p>Second, LTE, an abbreviation for "Long-Term Evolution", is a synonym for 4G networks. Therefore, both terms will be used interchangeably in this article.</p><h2 id=do-you-work-on-the-go>1. Do You Work on the Go?</h2><p>If your job requires constant trips (within town or to other cities), you know that Wi-Fi networks aren't always readily available. Borrowing internet from your phone may not be the best option as well: <a href=#>using it as a mobile hotspot</a> consumes a lot of battery, while <a href=#>USB tethering</a> keeps the device "grounded."</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>In such cases, a laptop with a SIM card tray getting you access to 5G or 4G may be a good option. This way, you don't need to count on luck to ensure your computer will be connected.</p><h2 id=is-the-fixed-broadband-at-your-home-and-workplace-reliable>2. Is the Fixed Broadband at Your Home and Workplace Reliable?</h2><p>Even if your job is in a fixed place, broadband connections there (or at home) may not be as reliable as you need. If no ISP offers a decent service where you live/work, perhaps a mobile carrier does.</p><p>In such cases, you may also <a href=#>consider a dedicated mobile hotspot</a>, also known as a MiFi device. But, if you only need the connection for your computer, why not get a laptop with LTE or 5G network support built-in?</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.howtogeekimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/52638488286_814dd9df98_o.jpg> <strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-you-need-protection-from-power-outages>3. Do You Need Protection From Power Outages?</h2><p>If you need to stay connected even during a power outage, a 4G or 5G-enabled laptop definitely helps. They provide a good failsafe to keep sharing cat videos working in such cases—without draining your phone's battery, which is even more precious when you can't charge it.</p><p>Keep in mind, however, that some more serious applications may require a constant connection. If you're, say, <a href=#>hosting a critical web server</a>, you should probably invest in one of the <a href=#>best uninterruptible power supply (UPS) units</a> instead.</p><h2 id=is-online-privacy-something-you-worry-about>4. Is Online Privacy Something You Worry About?</h2><p>Public hotspots, while convenient, may be <a href=#>unencrypted</a> and vulnerable to sniffing. You have no way of knowing if there's a hacker intercepting the traffic going through, say, the router in the coffee shop you're working from.</p><p>A dedicated mobile connection built-in your computer won't make you 100% safe—because <a href=#>nothing done online is ever 100% safe</a>. But at least, if your data leaks, you'll know your carrier is to blame.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><h2 id=do-you-need-a-somewhat-assuredly-fast-connection>5. Do You Need a (Somewhat) Assuredly Fast Connection?</h2><p>If you're on the go a lot, you not only depend on Wi-Fi hotspots being available, but also on them being usable. A laptop with mobile network support ensures you'll always have a fast connection—that is, as fast as your carrier provides.</p><p>If 5G networks are available where you live, there's a chance their quality is indistinguishable from fixed broadband. Speed and latency with a fifth-gen connection are usually so good that the major US carriers (<a href=#>AT&T</a>, <a href=#>T-Mobile</a>, and <a href=#>Verizon</a>) offer 5G plans for home usage—but remember to <a href=#>monitor bandwidth usage</a> to avoid data caps.</p><h2 id=laptops-with-lte-or-5g-are-useful-but-not-always-needed>Laptops With LTE or 5G Are Useful, but Not Always Needed</h2><p>There are quite a few scenarios in which having a laptop that supports mobile networks is indeed useful. But they're not strictly needed by everyone, and that's fine.</p><p>If you're on a tight budget, it may be better to <a href=#>get a lower-cost laptop</a>. You'll save some cash by using your phone's mobile hotspot.</p><strong class="an-zone-tag-top ad-zone-advertising-tag"></strong> <strong class="an-zone-tag-bottom ad-zone-advertising-sub-tag"></strong><p>If money isn't an issue, but you don't fall on the use cases for a computer 4G or 5G connection, consider investing in other features. Perhaps you'll be more satisfied with a <a href=#>convertible, 2-in-1 laptop</a>, or maybe you can just grab a regular one and buy some <a href=#>great PC accessories</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbvWraagnZWge6S7zGibqGWppMJuusSem2aZXaGuscDOqWSwoaSdenWzjKipZm2XZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
