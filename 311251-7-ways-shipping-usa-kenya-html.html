The service is ideal for smaller goods or items that do not require quick delivery. Also, some courier services offer fast delivery of packages within two to five business days. But what are the different ways of shipping from USA to Kenya?</p><h2>Modes shipping from USA to Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>You can use any of the following methods for shipping parcels from the United States to Kenya:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/3dfcc92ab4f21cdb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Amazing guide on how to become a Glover</span></p></a><h3>Air Shipping</h3><p class=align-left>If you are looking to import goods and get them delivered to you within days, air shipping is what you should consider. Many companies offer air shipping from USA to Kenya. Some examples include DHL, FedEx, and UPS. With air shipping, volume and weight are crucial factors that will determine the price.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO:</strong> Top shipping companies in Kenya</p><p class=align-left>Most air carriers charge by volumetric weight or dimensional weight and actual weight. That will all depend on which one will bring in more money for them. If you choose to go for air freights, consider things like:</p><ul><li><strong>Speed:</strong> You want the items to arrive within five days</li><li><strong>Protection: </strong>You want the items delivered without damages</li><li><strong>Reliability:</strong> You want to track your shipment</li></ul><p class=align-left>Also, choose the option if you are shipping things like electronics, apparels, documents, pharmaceuticals, or anything less than 50kgs. But while international air freight is convenient, they are expensive. Thus, do your calculations before opting for it.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/0cff054b8cff0718.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Container houses in Kenya: A complete guide</span></p></a><h3>Sea shipping</h3><p class=align-left>Ocean freight or sea shipping is the most common transport mode used by Kenyan importers. Companies that offer sea shipping from USA to Kenya include Kentex Cargo, States Duka, and Kenfreight Group, among many others. Unlike other modes, sea freight is ideal for shipping items as large as 500 Kgs.</p><p class=align-left>Ocean freight is cheaper and has fewer restrictions. You can ship packages in a large shipping container at low costs. Depending on the freight forwarder, they can consolidate your consignments to reduce costs. But while it is cheap, the method is slow. It can take up to 30 days for your items to arrive. Importers only choose it when they are not in a hurry to have their goods delivered.</p><p class=align-left><strong>READ ALSO: </strong>eBay shipping to Kenya: process, companies, and costs</p><h2>7 different ways to ship from USA to Kenya</h2><p class=align-left>The following is a list of services that you can use to facilitate shipping from the US to Kenya:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a1e7afe2038573e7.jpeg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>How to import goods from China to Kenya</span></p></a><h3>1.
