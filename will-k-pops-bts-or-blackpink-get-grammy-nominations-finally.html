Both acts have broken numerous records, staged major global tours and received an outpouring of support around the world.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But the American music market has been slow to recognise either act – or, for that matter, any other K-pop group, however popular – or to reward them for their efforts and musicality. And the MTV Video Music Awards in 2019 came under fire for introducing a K-pop category after years of ignoring the industry’s popularity.</p><h3 type=h3 data-qa=Component-Component class="e14khtrb0 css-17x7qa9 e793b7w1"><a class="link-text css-e0dnmk ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><p><span data-qa=DigitalArchiveLink-TitleText class="css-66qo9a eeeqn932">The best from the 2020 Grammys, from BTS to Demi Lovato</span></p></a></h3>One Korean-American industry insider in Seoul, South Korea, recently told the Post there were rumours that <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">SuperM’s “Super One”&nbsp;album,</span></a> produced by Capitol Records, might secure the group a nomination in the best new artist category, as it’s a coronavirus concept album.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Both “Super One” and Blackpink’s “The Album”&nbsp;hit the No 2 spot on the Billboard album chart this year.
