For ITZY’s upcoming comeback, it was <a href=#><strong>Lia</strong></a>‘s turn to take on the hair-changing task.</p><p>Being the only member who hasn’t bleached her hair since debut, the vocalist went blonde! “I was actually worried before dyeing it,” Lia told <a href=#>UpRoxx</a>. “It’s not like I wanted to do it, but it was a suggestion because I never tried dying my hair after debut. It was always dark so somehow I thought ‘Okay. I guess it’s my turn.'”</p><p></p><h2>Who Are ITZY?</h2><p>Known for their impressive choreography and catchy lyrics fueled with girl power, ITZY debuted as a girl group under JYP Entertainment on February 12, 2019. The members include leader&nbsp;<a href=#><strong>Yeji</strong>,&nbsp;Lia,&nbsp;<strong>Ryujin</strong>,&nbsp;<strong>Chaeryeong</strong>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<strong>Yuna</strong></a>.</p><p>ITZY’s name is a play on the Korean word “to have it all,” and the group is one of the most groundbreaking K-pop acts in the fourth generation.</p><p>“Our members were meant to perform,” Lia told&nbsp;Teen Vogue in August 2022. “Individually, their dance skills are awesome. Even when they were trainees, their dancing skills were great.”</p><p>“All the members are really capable in many ways,” Ryujin added. “We can be a performance group, but we can try anything and have a great result.”</p><p><strong>Click through our gallery for all the details on ITZY’s upcoming 2023 comeback.</strong></p><p>Love J-14?
