Clips of the videos, lines from the scripts and cringe-worthy scenes are still being shared on <a href=#>TikTok</a> despite the final installment of the franchise being released in 2012. It’s been 12 years, but we’re still not over Renesmee, okay? Jokes aside, the sheer mania around the <a href=#>Twilight movie</a> had a drastic effect on the stars, including <a href=#>Taylor Lautner</a>, who was too ‘scared’ to leave his home for a decade.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-taylor-lautner-was-afraid-of-screaming-fans-chasing-him-around>Taylor Lautner was afraid of screaming fans chasing him around</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2024/02/GettyImages-156435950-1024x682.jpg><p><a href=#>Movie</a> critics couldn’t see the infatuation teenage fans had with the cast coming, and unfortunately, neither did film bosses nor the crew themselves. There were serious debates between friends on whether they were Team Edward or Team Jacob, and definitely tears shed along the way.</p><p>Taylor Lautner first starred in the five-film saga at age 16, a youngster himself, when the first Twilight film was underway. He had already appeared in children’s flick SharkBoy and LavaGirl, but this was his big break that opened the doors of <a href=#>Hollywood</a>.</p><p>The now 31-year-old opened up over the Twilight obsession previously, and spoke about how his fame materialized ‘overnight’. But some of it was a disaster.</p><p>The <a href=#>celebrity</a> told Today: “Not many things in life can come and happen overnight. Fame can. It can also disappear overnight.</p><p>“When I was 16, 17, 18 years old, waking up and trying to just go out for a walk or go on a date and I had 12 cards waiting outside my house to follow me whenever I’m going or show up to an airport or anywhere, and you have thousands of fans screaming”.</p><p>He admitted spending 10 years avoiding doing regular things, like getting groceries or seeing a film at the cinema. When Taylor Lautner was able to go out normally when Twilight mania subsided, he said it felt like ‘freedom’.</p><p>The star, who briefly dated <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a>, said: “I went so many years not leaving my house, or if I did, hate, sunglasses and just like, scared.</p><p>“It built up something inside of me where, I didn’t know it, but I was scared to go out. I’d get super anxious to go out. So I just didn’t.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-it-was-tough-when-fame-disappeared>It was tough when ‘fame’ disappeared</h2><p>The grass always seems greener on the other side. However, it can sometimes be a harsh reality if you jump the fence. That’s what happened to Taylor Lautner after Twilight.</p><p>The last film, Breaking Dawn Part 2, came out in 2012, and he dabbled in other projects afterward. He appeared in Cuckoo and the popular Scream Queens, but decided to take a step back in 2016.</p><p>But he felt his fame was starting to slip and even though he wanted a “normal life”, he didn’t realize he’d care about it so much.</p><p>He added: “But then when that’s taken away from you at all, you start to question yourself and start to be like, ‘Oh, do people not care about me anymore?'”</p><p>“When it goes away a little bit, you notice it, and that’s the dangerous part because that can mess with your mind”.</p><p>But he hasn’t let it get to his head, as he feels he’s better than in recent years.</p><p>The star married his wife, Taylor née Dome in 2022. They often joke about how t<a href=#>hey have the same first name</a>. The celebrity couple met when he was on a hiatus from acting. Similar to Taylor Lautner dating Taylor Swift, although she later <a href=#>wrote a breakup song</a> about their split.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlqX2Z%2BcMDAsqOoql2hrrbAzZ6pZq%2BRqHq1u85mmJ%2BqkZ6xbsDOZqOemaaaeqm10mafqK2jmnqnu9FmaGllqZqus7%2BMm5ycmaWosm67xWarsKGcnrSpwI4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
