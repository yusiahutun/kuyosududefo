He Has Acted Suspiciously Gay In The Past</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-06-18</div><p><strong>Is Ryan Seacrest gay? Many have asked this question because of some things he has done in the past. Is there smoke behind this fire?&nbsp;</strong></p><p>Ryan Seacrest is an American media personality and producer best known as the co-host and executive producer of “Live with Kelly and Ryan” as well as the host of various media shows, including “American Idol.”</p><p>In the past few decades, there has been an increase in same-sex marriages between celebrities. This has made many people more sensitive about their relationships, and Seacrest is one of those stars who are under suspicion.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ryan-Seacrest.jpg><p>No, Ryan Seacrest is not gay. Based on his past relationships, the media personality’s sexuality is straight.&nbsp;</p><p>What makes the question tricky with Seacrest is that the TV personality seems to enjoy letting people misunderstand him. He has never confirmed nor denied allegations that he is gay and is even known to joke about it.&nbsp;</p><p>There are a couple of reasons why Seacrest has piqued people’s curiosity concerning his sexual orientation. A few of them are listed below.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Ryan_Seacrest_Gay_Because_He_Frequently_Makes_Gay_Jokes></span>Is Ryan Seacrest Gay Because He Frequently Makes Gay Jokes?&nbsp;<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Seacrest has been known to never pass up a chance to make homosexual jokes, even when he is on live TV. This has been observed several times, especially when he hosts “American Idol,” where he and one of the judges, Simon Cowell, always try to point the other out as gay.</p><p>The banters are always very subtle, so heterosexual people usually miss them. However, the gay audience never does. A good example was when Cowell claimed that the gay anthem “It’s Raining Men” was Seacrest’s favorite song.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Ryan-and-Simon.jpg><p>Another example was when the fashionable Seacrest revealed that Cowell often listens to Y.M.C.A at the “manhole.” Even Judge Randy Jackson has been known to join in.&nbsp;</p><p>He once <a href=#>joked</a> about how Seacrest gave his digits to male audience members of the popular show. Seacrest has claimed they were all just jokes aimed at breaking any stereotypes surrounding homosexuality, but some find that hard to believe.&nbsp;</p><p>Cowell has also been heard calling Seacrest “sweetheart.” The famous judge once told him openly that he needed to “come out” of the closet. It may be all jokes, as they said.</p><p>However, more people became convinced there may be an underlying truth to it. One day, Cowell was asked “Is Ryan Seacrest gay?” and rather than answer, he spoke in vague tones.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Is_Ryan_Seacrest_Gay_Because_Of_His_Fashion_and_Nuances></span>Is Ryan Seacrest Gay Because Of His Fashion and Nuances?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Seacrest spends a lot of time on live TV, which means his fans are usually tuned in to his behavior. Hence, it was not difficult for them to realize that he sometimes behaves in a feminine manner and also seems to enjoy flirting with other men.</p><p>During one peculiar episode of “American Idol,” Seacrest <a href=#>grabbed</a> a man in the audience and proceeded to dance with him. He has also been known to make flirtatious comments about Adam Lambert, an openly gay man.&nbsp;</p><p>There is also the small matter of the way he dresses. Seacrest has a great fashion sense and no doubt, looks good in a suit. However, he has also been known to turn up on red carpets dressed in female clothes.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Some_Women_He_Dated_In_The_Past_Thought_He_Was_Gay></span>Some Women He Dated In The Past Thought He Was Gay<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>The famous TV host was once in a relationship with Julianne Hough. She once <a href=#>claimed</a> that she was 18 when he first asked her out. However, Hough had her doubts about him then, which is why she was initially reluctant to be with him.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/gistfest.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/04/Hough-and-Ryan-Seacrest.jpg><p>In fact, Hough openly stated in an interview that she thought Seacrest was gay but that her assumption was wrong, and they ended up dating after a few years.</p><p>Another woman who thought he was gay is Britney Spears. In an old interview Seacrest had with the singer and Will-I-am, she seemed to be under the impression he was gay.&nbsp;</p><p>In the video, Will.I.Am and Seacrest were talking about cologne, and Will had asked if the “Live with Kelly and Ryan” host sprayed cologne on his “girl.”</p><p>The question seemed to shock Spears, who was seen mouthing the word “girl” while looking bemused.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Seacrest_Is_In_A_Relationship_With_A_Woman></span>Seacrest Is In A Relationship With A Woman<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Seacrest is not <a href=#>gay</a> and has been romantically linked with some women over the years, including Teri Hatcher, Sara Jean Underwood, and Shayna Taylor.&nbsp;</p><p>He is <a href=#>currently in a relationship</a> with Aubrey Paige Petcosky and has been since 2021. By the look of things, it seems they are in for the long haul.&nbsp;</p><p>There’s no doubt that the question “Is Ryan Seacrest gay?” will seize to exist if his relationship with Paige evolves into marriage.&nbsp;</p><p>However, the famous TV host will most likely never stop making his gay jokes which he believes is his way of breaking the stereotypes surrounding the minority group.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmifmajBp7HSrWWcp51ktrR50bKYp2Wjmq6kvsSsq2afka56qbGMoZisZZGYwaawjKysrKiZmLawwdKlsGafka56qrqMrZ%2BeZaCWwLV7</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
