However, he has mastered the balance between personal and professional life. Ari has managed to keep the nitty-gritty of his relationship with his wife relatively private over the years, but here's what we know.</p><h2>Ari&nbsp;Fleischer and His Wife</h2><p>Ari Fleischer has been happily married to Rebecca Davis, a.k.a.&nbsp;Becki, for almost 20 years.</p><p><a href=# rel="follow noopener">Ari met Becki</a> at his workplace, which happens to be the White House. She was working for the White House’s Office of Management and Budget, and he was a Press Secretary. It was a 'love at first sight'&nbsp; kind of moment for him, and he felt like knowing her more. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-607 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><p>You might want to see:&nbsp;<a href=# rel=follow>Jacqui Heinrich's Instagram Oozes of Love for Her Partner</a></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Then, the romance shifted from the White House to the White House tennis court. Apparently, that's where the two had their first date. Fleischer must have put up a mighty good game, as it took no longer than a year for the couple to get engaged.</p><p>Their little White House meetings turned into an evening with white gowns and shirts, as the couple tied tie the&nbsp;knot in 2002. Ari comes from a Jewish background, whereas Rebecca is Christian, so they promptly had an&nbsp;interfaith service in&nbsp;Indianapolis, Rebecca's hometown. <span id=ezoic-pub-ad-placeholder-608 class=ezoic-adpicker-ad></span></p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-under_second_paragraph"></span><p>Fleischer might not say it out loud too often, but he is indeed a loving man. Ari's wife wore a beautiful solitaire diamond ring from Tiffany's on her ring finger, with which Ari proposed to her&nbsp;in a private setting. Describing his beloved, he once&nbsp;<a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">said</a>,</p><span class="ezoic-autoinsert-ad ezoic-mid_content"></span><p>“She’s a wonderful, marvelous woman, and I’m incredibly lucky she said yes”</p><p>His wedding was one of the few instances of his personal life coming up in the headlines.
