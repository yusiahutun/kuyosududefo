Kelly Ripa and Mark Consuelos flirted with each other on Instagram when the Live With Kelly and Ryan host shared a throwback photo of them kissing at The Great Raid film premiere in 2005.
“Missn’ this kissn’ (and this dress),” Kelly, 49, captioned the romantic snap of her embracing her hubby in a skin-tight satin dress with Mark’s hand around her waist.
“Hand,” The Riverdale alum, also 49, wrote in the comments with four black heart emoji so Kelly replied, “I miss the hand too."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

In February, Kelly shared a clip of her lifting her <a href=#>2020 Oscars</a> gown to reveal producer Albert Bianchini hiding underneath.</p><p><a href=#>“Been there …,” Mark hilariously wrote</a> in the comments, but their 19-year-old daughter, <a href=#>Lola Consuelos</a>, didn’t think it was so funny. “Absolutely repulsive,” she said.</p><p>Then, in October 2019, the All My Children alum showed off Mark’s amazing body when she shared a <a href=#>photo</a> of them in bed. “This is your thirst trappy reminder to watch an all NUDE #riverdale TONIGHT on @thecwriverdale 8/7 central. Did I say nude?” she jokingly penned the caption. Although Kelly’s post got more than 147,000 likes, Lola thinks her mom should stop posting sexy snaps of her dad.</p><p>“<a href=#>That’s disgusting</a>,” she joked to the former actress when Lola was reminded of all the revealing photos Kelly has shared of Mark.&nbsp;“I block that out of my mind. I forgot that you even did that. I don’t even know if I follow you on Instagram still! I’m kidding, I would never.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.closerweekly.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/shutterstock_editorial_539901m.jpg><p>While on the topic, Lola told her mom that she should stop replying to haters on Instagram. “I just don’t even think you should give them the time of day,” she said in regards to Kelly standing up for herself when people criticize her or her family on Instagram. “I mean these people are sitting at home wishing they were you.”</p><p>“Irrelevant people should stay out of our lives,” Lola added, so Kelly said, “You’re always wiser than I am.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46knKWkqWK%2FqrzAZp2loaKpwG7DyK2fZqWRp7hur86nqq6dnKTAbrXNZqqwnZWperW00aium5mToHqxtM6tpmg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
