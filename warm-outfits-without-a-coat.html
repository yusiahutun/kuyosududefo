Those <a title="Fall 2013 Trend: Oversize&nbsp;Coats" href=# rel=noopener>oversize coats everyone is talking about</a> will have their moment in the sun eventually!</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/style-zen.jpg><p><strong>1. Wear a vest over flannel.<br></strong></p><p>If you’ve ever worn flannel, you know just how warm it is. Combined with the unmatchable heating powers of a cute little puffer vest, you’ll be both warm and stylish. Complete the look with a pair of skinny jeans and flat or low-heeled boots for a utilitarian-chic look.</p><p><img decoding=async alt="oversized sweater" src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/oversized-sweater.jpg width=430 height=645 sizes="(max-width: 430px) 100vw, 430px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></p><p><strong>2. Layer a chunky, oversize sweater over a trim, textured skirt.<br></strong></p><p>There are few things in the world more delightful than a giant sweater in a soft, thick knit. They’re just perfect for nippy, gray days where all you want to do is grab a coffee and snuggle up with a book. Luckily, they’re also on-trend at the moment, and look fantastic with a miniskirt (as seen here!) or a pair of leggings, accompanied by <a title="The 7 Types of Boots You Need to Have In Your Closet Every&nbsp;Fall" href=# rel=noopener>a solid set of stacked booties</a>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/oversized-sweater.jpg><p>&nbsp;<strong>3. Wear a giant cardigan—or more than one.<br></strong></p><p>The slightly more buttoned-up (literally!) cousin of the oversize knit sweater is the giant cardigan, which in some circles (read: our office) is known as the grandpa sweater. These sweaters come in silhouettes both big and small, oversize and curve-hugging. Our preference for cooler days: an oversized grandpa sweater in a thick knit and creative pattern. Feel free to layer it on top of a T-shirt, a chambray, or even another, slim-fit&nbsp;grandpa sweater if you’re feeling bold (and cold).</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/stockholm-streetstyle-cardigan1.jpg><p><strong>4. Wear a big, bulky scarf.</strong></p><p>The warming powers of a seemingly never-ending scarf cannot be underestimated—and it’s very fortunate for us that these soft wraps will never go out of style. Whether it’s a scarf of thick cotton, sweater blend, or possibly even—prepare for your mind to be blown!—wearing more than one normal-sized scarf at once, it’s sure to keep you chic and toasty at the same time. (Plus, <a title="How to Tie a Scarf: 4 Chic Ways to Wear This Fall&nbsp;Essential" href=# rel=noopener>there are so many different ways to wear them</a>!)</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/the-sf-style-huge-scarf2.jpg><p><strong>5. Sweatshirts, sweatshirts, sweatshirts.<br></strong></p><p>As we’ve seen, <a title="The Fashion Sweatshirts Trend Is Taking Over For Fall: 15 To Shop&nbsp;Now" href=# rel=noopener>the fashion sweatshirt is a big thing this season</a>—both in terms of trends and size. These are both very good things, because it means that wearing a sweatshirt that hits mid-thigh will keep you both feeling warm and looking cool. It’s also great for <a href=# id=auto-tag_layering data-tag=layering>layering</a>: try it over a loose-fitting chambray shirt or a classic flannel with a leather skirt, tights, and boots.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/10/stockholm-streetstyle1.jpg><p><strong>6. Wear a maxi dress.</strong></p><p>Just because summer is over doesn’t mean you have to retire your oft-worn maxi dresses to the back of your closet. Au contraire, they are actually fabulous for layering: just throw on a sweater and a belt, or wear a pair of tights for extra warmth, and a pair of flat boots like the <a title="Shop It Now: 10 Stylish Backpacks For Your Inner Cher&nbsp;Horowitz" href=# rel=noopener><strong>Alexander Wang</strong></a> beauties shown here.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57xZqqoaGfo3ynrdKhoKimXam2sb%2BOa2dxcWBsfLit0aZkqK2km7a1v4ywoK2gn6rBbq2MnKaarF8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
