She said: "Their answer would be that I am the strict one. I never in a million years thought that was going to be me, but someone has to keep everything moving."</p><p id=e-E_P4adcHg data-wc=48>However, she insisted she doesn't believe in setting rules for her kids, as she believes that will only result in rebellion.

Nicole told People in 2018: "She should have this [Urban Decay] campaign. She is like a glitter, a liner, a liquid liner, a blush, a lipstick, a YouTube tutorial video. She is in it."</p><p id=e3qQFCEojREw data-wc=32>She has since joked that she turns to her daughter for beauty advice, asking for her help with her eyebrows, while Harlow has begun to steal clothes out of her mother's wardrobe.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/afe41efb13a5-gettyimages-2126140067.jpg><p id=e3jD3FQ1GFnL data-wc=51>"My daughter loves fashion, but she has her own style. It doesn't have anything to do with me.<a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>&nbsp;She takes my clothes all the time</a>," Richie said in August 2021. "I have just started writing an N with a Sharpie on all of my stuff so that [she knows it's mine]."</p><p id=e6vF-r4HR1CE data-wc=43>While both of her children have witnessed her performance in <a class=hm-link href=#>The Simple Life</a>, they are not in any hurry to follow in their mother's famous footsteps.

"He's just wild and crazy and you always have to watch (him.) He always has bruises on him, like you can't take your eyes off him for a second."</p><p id=eV3mEYDOyzRJ data-wc=20>However, he takes inspiration from his rock star dad when it comes to his style, favouring black clothes and bandanas.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/landscape/9d0116b3de66-gettyimages-2134291912.jpg><p id=eqwNlpMJmi2x data-wc=50>"Sparrow's actually dressing himself now but he's very particular," Richie said of her then-three-year-old son. "So he needs the bandana tied around the belt, you know how Joel does it… he has to have all of his sleeves cut off of his shirts. He's got a little curly mohawk now!"</p><p id=ezgrtVxvF5Lg data-wc=28>Since then, he has continued to be Joel's mini-me, with Nicole admitting in 2016: "Sparrow does his own thing. He likes to wear all black like his dad."</p><p id=e8wbUJlc8Qt1 data-wc=43>While the family of four all wore co-ordinating black outfits for the Don't Tell Mom The Babysitter's Dead premiere in April, Harlow chose a feminine strapless top and leather trousers, styling her long blonde hair – much like Nicole's – in loose curls.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/796553def720-gettyimages-537759430.jpg><p id=ex_Q75_QuJ8Q data-wc=23>Meanwhile, Sparrow's black T-shirt, slouchy jeans and black sneakers were strikingly similar to Joel's ensemble – minus the cap and the bomber jacket.</p><p id=eOsQasvImT data-wc=11><strong>DON'T MISS:&nbsp;</strong><a class=hm-link href=#>Rachel Weisz and Daniel Craig's children you never see</a></p><h2 class="newsletterTitleClass_nlzr60o hm-heading">Sign up to HELLO Daily! for the best royal, celebrity and lifestyle coverage</h2><span class=newsletterDisclaimerClass_ncg5smk><p>By entering your details, you are agreeing to HELLO!
