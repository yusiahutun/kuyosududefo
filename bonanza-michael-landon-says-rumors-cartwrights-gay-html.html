According to <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Outsider</a>, the “Cartwright Curse” was named after the family. The curse meant that the main character in a series doesn’t get to have a close relationship with the person they’re in love with either dying or leaving.</p><p id=par-3_38>Lorne Greene played Ben Cartwright, and Ben had three wives throughout his lifetime.

There were a lot of rumors about the Cartwrights being homosexual. Landon noted he was there to “set the record straight” with Carson. “We were not,” he said, but he joked that “Hop Sing was.” Hop Sing cooked for the Cartwrights in their household and was very influential in their lives. The Cartwrights considered him a close family member rather than just the chef in the house.</p><h2>Michael Landon had multiple wives in his lifetime</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/12/Michael-Landon-Bonanza.jpg><p id=par-9_62>While the Cartwright’s relationships didn’t always dominate the Bonanza storylines, <a href=#>Michael Landon had several marriages</a> of his own.
