Talking to Loudwire Nights, Robinson&nbsp;shares that&nbsp;he met Wilson&nbsp;on the red carpet at a country awards show. The&nbsp;Black Crowes&nbsp;joined&nbsp;<a href=#>Darius Rucker</a> for a <a href=#>performance of "She Talks&nbsp;to Angels"</a> at the 2023 CMT Music Awards.</p><p>"She was such a sweetheart and she was like, 'Oh my god, I grew up listening to the Black Crowes,'" Robinson recalls.</p><p>"We just had a little moment in between interviews and whatever ... (Producer Jay Joyce) asked her and she just did it."</p><p>Joyce also produced Wilson's last two albums. "Wilted Rose" marks the first time the Black Crowes have ever worked with another singer on an album.</p><p><strong>Related</strong>: <a href=#>Top 10 Black Crowes Songs</a></p><p>This duet further expands Wilson's reputation as country music's most dynamic female artist.

She also cut a version of the <a href=#>Rolling Stones</a>' "You Can't Always Get What You Want" for the Stone Cold Country tribute to the Stones, and she acted on the&nbsp;Western drama, <a href=#>Yellowstone</a>.</p><p>"I was in L.A., it was kind of after the main part of the record and we heard it and were like, 'Wow,'" Robinson recalls in this interview. "I mean, of course, she's incredibly talented and she's having her superstar moment. We're really happy for her and she's going to go on and do great things. She's already doing it."</p><p>Wilson is also thought to be working on her next studio album, but no details or songs have leaked from those sessions.
