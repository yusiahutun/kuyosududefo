I didn‚Äôt understand how Jamie Lynn and our father had developed such a good relationship. She knew I was reaching out to her for help and that she was dogging me. I felt like she should have taken my side." While on lithium, "they were only visiting to finish off what they‚Äôd started a few months earlier, to kill me for real."</p><p>Britney also criticized her sister for releasing her own memoir, Things I Should Have Said, in 2021.</p><p>"As I was fighting the conservatorship and receiving a lot of press attention, she was writing a book capitalizing on it. She rushed out salacious stories about me, many of them hurtful and outrageous," wrote the singer. She added, "She will always be my sister, and I love her and her beautiful family. I'm working to feel more compassion than anger toward her, and everyone who I feel has wronged me. It's not that easy."</p><p>Jamie Lynn and Britney appear to have a strained relationship, although the currently status of the sisters is unclear.</p><p>"I'm A Celebrity‚Ä¶Get Me Out Of Here!" premieres on this Sunday on ITV1 and ITVX.</p><a id=gallery-link-9c1d8c0d-77f3-4ea8-a67b-0eab43867a0e class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:9c1d8c0d-77f3-4ea8-a67b-0eab43867a0e data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:1c3fadb1-f9b9-4209-b051-2b9d71e26a6b data-gallery-layout=list><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/54/4by3/2023/10/24/543cf033042f48a7a79a2e9d81f3e045_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7kGpmamxfn66utcRmo7KmnmLAsbHAq6pmop%2Beu7R5yKZkmmWTmrmmrtGiq7Jlkqe2tbrEsmSfmZ6oerW%2BzqWjZqCVp3qzwdOho56ro6HGcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. ¬© 2022.
