We're left to guess how one is reacted to on the street in these tops (but we assume with a feeling of insult for the former), but one does not have to wonder how wearing one in a photo on Instagram will perform. The numbers are right there, bottom left of the square image. Are fashion houses blatantly catering to today's casual (yet pervasive) narcissism? Instagram currently boasts 300 million active daily users—that's a lot of people partaking in our current "look at me culture."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=2 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Thanks to social media, and Instagram in particular, narcissism has arguably swept the nation like Pokemon with a vanity issue. But there is a "chicken or egg" element to it—were people narcissistic to begin with and now they simply have a platform for it, or is social media breeding narcissism? "Probably a bit of both," Dr. Lisa Firestone, clinical psychologist and senior editor for <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__www.psychAlive.org&d=DQMFAg&c=B73tqXN8Ec0ocRmZHMCntw&r=4kKDj2OAvERZJnMpKpKyiguEfi-jx_PUTmjrV1EjHLk&m=mPFh8pc9v9SFPdGvmdHLaV-c0f-5AHjsAyLCWm7UDyQ&s=wTInU532SWVv3b53PV5w7AAgutpXw3sB10dFsMy5qsU&e=" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Psych Alive" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Psych Alive</a>, explains, "To me, narcissism is–and I think this holds up in research–desperately wanting to feel good about yourself, and it's different than feeling good about yourself. It's not a solid sense of self; it's a sense of self that needs continual reinforcement." And what better way to get reinforcement than actual double taps?</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=4 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">If those <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=http://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/10/t-magazine/the-circus-of-fashion.html data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="street style take-downs" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">street style take-downs</a> of the past few years have taught us anything, it's that the people who get photographed and post their own photographs most often are the unabashed magpies and the proud peacocks. And now Instagram has made fashion month street style a virtual year-round enterprise.</p><img alt="Land vehicle, Car, Magenta, Street fashion, Auto part, Mesh, Dress, Bag, Grille, Wire fencing, " title="Land vehicle, Car, Magenta, Street fashion, Auto part, Mesh, Dress, Bag, Grille, Wire fencing, " width=980 height=579 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hbz.h-cdn.co/assets/16/38/1474655534-hbz-street-style-nyfw-ss2017-day6-131.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Diego Zuko</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">There is a delineation between an interest and appreciation in style and a need to stand out for standing-out sake. "It's interesting, because I don't think all people who are into fashion are narcissists or doing it for display," Dr. Firestone continues, "It [narcissism] is different than just paying attention to trends and caring about looking good; it's wanting to stand out. It's not even necessarily about looking good, exactly."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">And recent fashion is all about standing out—what with the exaggerated proportions at Balenciaga, the towering platforms at Marc Jacobs, the sequins, cats and layers at Gucci and all of those shirts and jackets by Vetements with phrases that seem to beg to be read, looked at, provoke inquiry. Making an entrance in a room used to mean just the right Valentino red or Le Smoking suit, but now to get noticed for photographers or social media sites it takes a certain degree of quirk, irony, the off-kilter.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"It's not necessarily that we have more people meeting the full criteria for narcissistic personality disorder—which is a very serious condition and I don't think that most of the people that we're casually calling narcissists would fit that diagnosis," Dr. Firestone continues, "but they're demonstrating narcissistic traits: needing that attention, caring more about the image than the content." And would women have supported "You F*cking Asshole" as a desirable phrase on a t-shirt before the Instagram age? Who can even remember that time anymore?</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/89754333-a030-4699-b9fa-0dfa137fc094_1496780517.jpg alt="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" title="Headshot of Kerry Pieri" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Kerry Pieri is Harper's Bazaar's Digital Fashion/Features Director.
