Terrence played basketball for the Kentucky Wildcats in college. He made a significant contribution to them winning the national championship in 2012.</p><h2><span id=What_is_the_Net_Worth_of_Terrence_Jones_Salary_Earnings>What is the Net Worth of Terrence Jones? Salary, Earnings</span></h2><p>Terrence Jones’ net worth is estimated to be between <strong>$1</strong> and <strong>$5 million</strong>, according to sources. He has amassed a substantial fortune from NBA league games. However, the precise amount is unknown.</p><p>Jones was selected in the first round of the 2012 NBA Draft by the Houston Rockets. The club offered him nearly $1.4 million for his rookie season alone because he was already known as a capable power forward.</p><p>He saw very little playing time in his first season, but the club increased both his salary and playing time in his second season. As a result, he earned slightly more than $1.5 million in his second season. Furthermore, he earned around $4 million over the next two seasons with the Rockets, despite missing the majority of the games due to injuries.</p><p>Terrence has amassed a wealth of up to $8.5 million as a result of his NBA career. He also went abroad to play for various foreign clubs, where he was one of the highest-paid players.</p><p>So, playing basketball has undoubtedly earned him a lot of money. Anyone who follows the NBA closely knows that if injuries and accidents had not hampered his career, he would have earned much more.</p><h2><span id=Where_was_Terrence_Jones_born_Ethnicity_Nationality_Family_Education>Where was Terrence Jones born? Ethnicity, Nationality, Family, Education</span></h2><p>Terrence Alexander Jones, better known as Terrence Jones, was born in Portland, Oregon,<strong> on January 9, 1992.</strong> Dennis Jones (father) and Linda Mashia- Jones (mother) are both Oregon natives (Mother). Jones’s parents were not wealthy, but they did everything they could to make him happy.</p><p>Terrence grew up in Portland, Oregon, where he attended Thomas Jefferson High School. He began his basketball career at the same school. Jones had always been physically strong and athletic, so he excelled in extracurricular activities.</p><p>His interest in basketball games grew significantly over time. Because his cousins were already well-known basketball players at the time, he, too, began to harbor ambitions of greatness in the sport. Damon and Salim Stoudamire, his cousins, are both former NBA players. Damon is currently an assistant coach for the Boston Celtics, a well-known NBA team.</p><p>Terrence’s parents also encouraged him to pursue his dreams. As a result, in his spare time, he would frequently engage in basketball games with his friends in the neighborhood. He continued his studies and pursued his college career at the University of Kentucky (UK) after graduating in 2010.</p><p><strong>College Life</strong></p><p>He considered attending the University of Washington after graduating from high school. His childhood friend and famous NBA player Terrence Ross encouraged him to join him there.</p><p>However, he dropped out and enrolled at the University of Kentucky instead. Jones appeared in all 38 games of his rookie season and posted impressive stats. That season, he averaged 15.7 points and 8.8 rebounds per game.</p><p>Similarly, he was allowed to play in all games of the season after earning the trust of his team with his performance during the first season. Terrence had considered leaving college after his first season, but he decided against it.</p><p>As a sophomore, he maintained his elite level of play, averaging 12.3 points per game in 38 games. In the same season, he led the Kentucky Wildcats to the NCAA championship. Terrence decided to leave college after the second season and enter the 2012 NBA draft.</p><h2><span id=Quick_Facts>Quick Facts</span></h2><table style="width:80%;margin:0 auto"><tbody><tr><td width=468><strong>Full Name</strong></td><td width=468>Terrence Alexander Jones</td></tr><tr><td><strong>Known As</strong></td><td>Terrence Jones</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Date of Birth</strong></td><td width=468>January 9, 1992</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Birth Place</strong></td><td width=468>Portland, Oregon, the USA</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Nick Name</strong></td><td width=468>Not available</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Religion</strong></td><td width=468>Christianity</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Nationality</strong></td><td width=468>American</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Zodiac Sign&nbsp;</strong></td><td width=468>Capricorn</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Age</strong></td><td width=468>30&nbsp;years old</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Height</strong></td><td width=468>2.06 m (6 feet 9 inches)</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Weight</strong></td><td width=468>252 lb (114 kg)</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Hair Color</strong></td><td width=468>Black</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Eye Color</strong></td><td width=468>Dark brown</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Build</strong></td><td width=468>Athletic</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Father’s Name</strong></td><td width=468>Dennis Jones</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Mother’s Name</strong></td><td width=468>Linda Mashia- Jones</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Siblings</strong></td><td width=468>Not available</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Education</strong></td><td width=468><ul><li>Thomas Jefferson High School (Portland, Oregon)</li><li>University of Kentucky (Lexington, Kentucky)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Marital Status</strong></td><td width=468>Unmarried</td></tr><tr><td width=468><b>Sexual Orientation</b></td><td width=468>Straight</td></tr><tr><td width=468><b>Girlfriend</b></td><td width=468>None</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Kid’s name</strong></td><td width=468>Ajani Jones</td></tr><tr><td width=468><b>Food Habit</b></td><td width=468>Non-vegetarian</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Profession</strong></td><td width=468>Basketball player</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>NBA Draft</strong></td><td width=468>2012</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Position</strong></td><td width=468>Power forward</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Active Years</strong></td><td width=468>(2012 – present)</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Net Worth</strong></td><td width=468>$1 – $5 million</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Currently Club</strong></td><td width=468>Grand Rapids Gold</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Jersey Number</strong></td><td width=468>Unknown</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Career Highlights & Awards</strong></td><td width=468><ul><li>NCAA Champion (2012)</li><li>McDonald’s All-American (2010)</li><li>SEC Rookie of The Year (2011)</li><li>SEC All-Rookie Team (2011)</li></ul></td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Social Media&nbsp;</strong></td><td width=468>Instagram,&nbsp;Twiter</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Merch</strong></td><td width=468>Cards</td></tr><tr><td width=468><strong>Last Update</strong></td><td width=468>September 2022</td></tr></tbody></table><h2><span id=Is_Terrence_Jones_Single_Relationship_Girlfriend>Is Terrence Jones Single?
