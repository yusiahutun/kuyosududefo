Botox jabs could offer a long-lasting solution for those who suffer the discomfort and embarrassing ‘blushing’ of rosacea.
When tiny droplets of the wrinkle-busting nerve toxin are injected in diluted form into the forehead and cheeks, they have been found to reduce the redness which is the main symptom of the incurable skin disease."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Complications from the procedure are rare, Dr Dayan said, with just one reported case in 100 of temporary weakness in the facial muscles.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Beki Darin, 65, from Chicago, was one of the first patients to be treated by Dr Dayan some ten years ago. The married estate agent said: ‘I suffered from moderate acne in my teens, and just when I thought I was going to have clear skin, I got rosacea. I would go red as if I had sunburn.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘I tried everything in the book. I used creams and ointments, laser, I tried changing my diet, I stopped eating spicy food and drinking alcohol, I would stay out of the sun – you name it, I did it.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘One day, I went to Dr Dayan to have Botox for my wrinkles and we noticed it seemed to work on my rosacea, so we did it all over my face. I have been a devotee ever since. I go in every four months, and no longer need any creams, and I can eat and drink what I like. I’ve not had a single side effect, and I feel free.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Cosmetic injectable expert Dr Kuldeep Minocha welcomed the research, saying: ‘Any skin condition that affects the face has a significant psychological impact, and this is definitely something I’d consider offering once we know more about how it works and exactly what we can promise to patients.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>The GP, who sees patients at his London clinic, Absolute Aesthetics, added: ‘The treatment seems promising and as we’ve got decades of experience using these toxins in the face, it’s likely to be safe and cause few complications.</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>‘At present, though, we can’t be sure how it is working, and exactly which patients it will work for.’</p><p class=mol-para-with-font>Dr Dayan admitted: ‘I don’t believe it works on everyone. There’s a select group of people on whom it works better. And I am not yet sure what makes someone an ideal candidate.’&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaKCVlrm1tI6aqa2hk6GyboCVcG9pbGBkjm62wJtke6ekpMVutMSlp2aqlZnCpLGMq5ydppWowG6v1K1krKifqcBvtNOmow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
