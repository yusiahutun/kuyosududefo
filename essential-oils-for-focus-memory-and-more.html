Or the name of that person you met the other day who’s now greeting you (by your name, of course) in the grocery store? These scenarios happen to us all — and when they do we worry about dementia or aging in general. But astounding new research at the University of California, Irvine, shows a way to improve memory, focus and brainpower so we don’t need to worry: inhaling the scent of essential oils!</p><p>The UC Irvine neuroscientists exposed healthy subjects, ages 60 to 85, to one of seven essential oils (rose, orange, eucalyptus, lemon, peppermint, rosemary or lavender) for two hours as they slept. Half of subjects used vials containing mostly distilled water, with small amounts of essential oil; the rest received vials with the same essential oils at full-strength. The findings? After six months, the full-strength oil <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">improved subjects cognitive performance by 226% </a>compared to the control group. Cognitive function is a term that encompasses a range of mental functions including memory, perception, reasoning, decision-making and language comprehension.</p><p class=inline-stn-player></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>The science behind aromas and brainpower</h2><p>How did these seven oils create this powerful result? MRIs revealed a stronger brain pathway known as the left uncinate fasciculus in those who were exposed to the full-strength oil. The investigators say this pathway becomes less active as we age, which is key since it plays a role in functions associated with thinking, emotions and memory formation.</p><p>This isn’t the first study to show a link between essential oils and memory, but other findings weren’t as practical in the real world: <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">One required subjects to inhale as many as 40 different odors twice daily</a>! “The reality is that over the age of 60, the olfactory sense and cognition starts to fall off a cliff,” says <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Michael Leon, PhD</a>, professor of neurobiology & behavior and a fellow at the school’s Center for the Neurobiology of Learning & Memory. “But it’s not realistic to think people with cognitive impairment could open, sniff and close 80 odorant bottles daily. This would be difficult even for people without dementia.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Boost your memory while you sleep</h2><p>“By making it possible for people to experience the odors while sleeping, we eliminated the need to set aside time for this during waking hours every day,” says lead study author<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Cynthia Woo</a>. But she’s quick to add that the same results would apply simply by turning on a diffuser and inhaling the scents of these oils for two hours during the day.</p><p>And while the researchers stress that more study is needed to see if this same technique can help those already diagnosed with early dementia, they say it’s an easy and inexpensive way to protect your brain as you age.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Additional benefits of essential oils</h2><p>More good news: Essential oils are proven to enhance health in so many ways! We looked at the oils used in the UCI study to see how else they can help you feel your best. Read on for the many perks.

Don’t want to carry around a vial of the oil? Add 3 drops rosemary essential oil to a cotton ball and place inside a clean, empty lip balm jar, then unscrew the lid and take a whiff anytime, anywhere.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Boosts happiness:</strong> Inhaling rosemary’s fresh scent for 30 minutes <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">increases levels of the hormone dopamine by 97%</a>, Japanese research suggests — and the benefit persists all day, with an increase in happiness and motivation. For an easy way to scent the air, simmer a few tablespoons of rosemary in an uncovered slow cooker with water. Or make a DIY room spray by adding 25 drops of rosemary essential oil, 4 oz. of witch hazel and 4 oz. of distilled water to a spritz bottle then lightly mist the air around you.</p><p><strong>Supercharges focus:</strong> Taking six slow, deep sniffs of rosemary essential oil when you start to feel foggy can leave you clear-headed and focused. British researchers say a compound in rosemary oil can <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">heighten alertness, focus and mental stamina in as little as 30 seconds</a>.

In a study at the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis, subjects who were exposed to the scent of lavender at night were <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">87% more likely to wake up feeling refreshed</a> than those who followed the same sleep schedule but didn’t get inhale the scent. Plus, lavender-sniffers were also 37% less likely to report sleepiness during the day. To get the perks: Add a few drops of lavender essential oil to an aromatherapy diffuser at night, or lightly mist your sheets with the scent before bed.

A happy bonus: German research suggests focusing on smelling pleasant scents daily optimizes brain function,<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> reducing your risk of dementia by as much as 50%</a>.</p><p><strong>Tames pain:</strong> Massaging lavender oil into tender spots or adding it to your bath <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">can reduce pain by 58%</a>, say researchers at the Cleveland Clinic. To make a massage lotion, mix 25 drops of lavender oil into 2 oz. of any carrier oil or unscented lotion. To add to a bath, mix lavender oil into a dollop of shampoo, first, so it will disperse.</p><p><strong>Eases hot flashes: </strong>A study in the Journal of the Chinese Medical Association found that the sweet, floral aroma of lavender prompts the brain to release beta-endorphins, calming hormones that also <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">prevent sudden temperature fluxes</a>. Study co-author <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Roya Nikjou, MSc</a>, says rubbing diluted lavender essential oil into your neck, shoulders and arms three times daily could cut your risk of hot flashes by as much as 50%. To make: Mix 12 drops of the oil into 1 oz of unscented lotion.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Orange essential oil</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/GettyImages-1445304387.jpg><p><strong>Supercharges energy:</strong> Scientists reporting in the journal Molecules say orange oil boasts 26 aromatic compounds that stimulate the sympathetic nervous system, plus increase glucose and fat burn in muscle tissue, <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">doubling energy and stamina for almost two hours</a> per sniff. Plus, you can get the perk even if you don’t have a vial of the oil handy by simply nibbling a few slices of orange or sipping a little OJ.</p><p><strong>Tames stress:</strong> A study in the journal Advanced Biomedical Research found that smelling orange essential oil <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">drastically reduced anxiety</a>. Their research looked at patients undergoing a simple dental procedure and found that those in the group that had the orange aromatherapy decreased their salivary cortisol by 84%, plus saw an 82% drop in pulse rate.</p><p><strong>Eases pain:</strong> One study in the Indian Journal of Palliative Care suggests the aroma of orange essential oil <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">can reduce pain</a>. In their study, patients who were in a hospital emergency room for treatment of broken bones who had a pad containing four drops of the oil pinned to their collars experienced significantly lower levels of pain than other patients who weren’t given the oil.

To do: Mix four drops of peppermint oil into a dollop of lotion and firmly massage into your neck, forehead and temples — or mix 10 drops of the oil into 2 cups of warm water and massage into your scalp for two minutes before shampooing.</p><p><strong>Eases GI distress: </strong>Peppermint oil can help ease the abdominal pain, constipation and diarrhea of irritable bowel syndrome (IBS), report researchers in BMC Complementary & Alternative Medicine. In a review of data from 835 IBS patients, those who took peppermint oil capsules <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">were more than twice as likely to see an improvement in IBS symptoms</a> than those who took a placebo, and 78% more likely to have reduced abdominal pain. The researchers say peppermint oil contains antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory and anti­oxidant properties, which help regulate the immune system and prevent ­muscle spasms. &nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Lemon essential oil</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2023/08/GettyImages-610885220.jpg><p><strong>Calms motion sickness: </strong>Brazilian investigators have found that the oil’s active ingredient, limonene, quickly soothes an upset stomach and <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">calms the nausea center in the brain</a>.
