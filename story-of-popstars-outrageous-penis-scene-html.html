As it unfolds, Connor points to a set of exposed breasts in the window behind him as an example of the relationship he has with fans, and indicates his intent to sign them. But, unbeknownst to Conner, while he was making his grand declarations the boobs were replaced by a flaccid penis, which he still proceeds to inscribe. Unlike in <i>Forgetting Sarah Marshall</i>, that junk isn’t just glimpsed; it’s the star of the scene, continuously cut to over and over, and eventually it gets caught in the car window.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a891186b181528bc42b07d349f64180d-2-0-3@published data-word-count=65><span>Beyond outrageous and unforgettable —<a href=#> as I noted in my essay on the Lonely Island last week</a> — it felt like the culmination of their years of dick jokes.<span class=apple-converted-space>&nbsp;</span>So, when I spoke with the guys earlier this month, it was all I wanted to talk about.

What was originally there?<br></b><i>Akiva Schaffer</i>: When we were writing the movie, we thought it would be more satisfying story-wise if we kept our characters apart basically for the whole movie. That scene in the hallway, where Conner calls out Owen on the <i>Parent Trap </i>thing, had a whole second half where he basically says, “Get fucking rid of him. I don’t want to see him. I’ll be at the hotel, bye.” And then there was a scene of my character and Owen in a bar basically with him trying to be like, “Hey, let’s get a drink.”</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a891186b181528bc42b07d349f64180d-5-0-0@published data-word-count=10><i>Andy Samberg</i>: Trying to spin it like it’s all good.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a891186b181528bc42b07d349f64180d-6-0-0@published data-word-count=57><i>Schaffer</i>: And me being like, “Where is he?” And him being like, “Oh, he’s just sick.” And me being like, “I’m not fucking falling for it,” and I kind of lecture him about why Conner’s manipulating him and that he should stand up for himself, too. I put ideas in his head about standing up for himself.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a891186b181528bc42b07d349f64180d-7-0-0@published data-word-count=103><b>Which would’ve set up how Owen eventually left Conner?</b><i><br>Schaffer</i>: That was the only part of it that we end up missing. The scene was actually totally fine; it wasn’t like, “Oh, we really have something broken here.” No one saw the movie and pinpointed that as the problem. But Judd was always like, “I think we’re just missing an opportunity here. That’s the story everyone’s watching for, the three of you guys together.” And he zeroed in on that scene. We did a ton of different edits and finally got two really good versions of it.

The logic was if they’re always apart and you don’t get to see them together, then at the farm when they’re finally face to face it will feel heightened.

We shot all these takes, we’re cutting it together, and they all have the moment. And there’s the long version where you really indulge in it, and there’s the one where it happens but you just see it once. It’s 11th hour of editing and we’ve already tested, so we know we only have one or two shots to see this in front of an audience, and we also know that if it doesn’t go great the first time, the studio’s going to bring in all the notes.</p><p class=clay-paragraph data-editable=text data-uri=www.vulture.com/_components/clay-paragraph/instances/ambrose-a891186b181528bc42b07d349f64180d-26-0-0@published data-word-count=99>So we were like, “We gotta play it safe.
