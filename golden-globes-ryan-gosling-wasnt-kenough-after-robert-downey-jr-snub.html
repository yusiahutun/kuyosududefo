Ryan Gosling‘s fan-favorite roles include The Notebook and La La Land, but that all changed in July 2023 – the month of Barbie. Starring as the insecure, and horse-loving doll constantly vying for Barbie’s attention, Gosling, 43, won the hearts of film fanatics with his hilarious improv and full camp costumes, but he failed to win over Golden Globes voters on Sunday night."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Ryan lost out to Robert Downey Jr for Best Performance by a Male Actor in a Supporting Role in Any Motion Picture, as did Willem Dafoe (Poor Things), Robert De Niro (Killers Of The Flower Moon), Charles Melton (May December), and Mark Ruffalo (Poor Things).</p><p>Given the Barbie craze of summer ’23, social media was divided by the Golden Globes outcome, while others agreed Downey Jr rightfully won with his unrecognizable portrayal of Lewis Strauss.</p><p>“How did Robert Downey Jr beat Ryan Gosling for that Golden Globe? Already shocked,” a fan wrote on <a href=#>Twitter</a>. “Both great performances. I just thought Gosling had it on lock.”</p><p>A second person agreed: “Robert Downey Jr over Gosling? pfffffft.” We’re sure the other Kens weren’t too happy about the result either.</p><p>“Ryan Gosling could have played Strauss just as well, but not a CHANCE Robert Downey Jr could have played Ken,” another pointed out. Agreed, we can’t picture a Ken a la Robert Downey Jr.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-why-ryan-gosling-and-wife-eva-mendes-never-appear-on-red-carpets-together>Why Ryan Gosling and wife Eva Mendes never appear on red carpets together</h2><p>For those of you who didn’t know, Ryan has been in a 13-year relationship with actress Eva Mendes and together they share two daughters. Despite being a leading actor, Gosling is one-half of Hollywood’s most lowkey couples ever and that’s exactly why Eva rarely joins him on the red carpet – including the Golden Globes.</p><p>Their only joint appearance was an event for 2012’s The Place Beyond the Pines, the crime drama that first connected them.</p><p>In April 2023, Mendes, 49, revealed it was unlikely she would appear on any Barbie red carpets – or any future event – with her partner because “we don’t do those things together.” The couple has never posted joint family photos either.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlpX2WFcLPOpZuepl2cubCuxKxkq7GRo3qou9KloKefXayutLrTZqKepp%2BqtKl5wJ%2Brnqpdp7yjsdGtZJ2np6OyunnJq2SspqWXfA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
