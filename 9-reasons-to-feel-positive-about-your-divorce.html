But, with everything else going on, 2020 felt quite a good year to quietly terminate a marriage. If you need proof that I’m on-trend with my life choices, <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-asia-china-54972762 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="last year divorces were up almost 20 per cent" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">last year divorces were up almost 20 per cent</a> and 2020 could be higher still with experts predicting a <a href=# rel=nofollow data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-54117821 data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="‘post-lockdown divorce boom’" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">‘post-lockdown divorce boom’</a>. While I’m thriving as a divorcée (doesn’t it just roll off the tongue?), if you’re mid-break-up or facing the uphill struggle of legal paperwork, acrimonious settlement talks and life upheaval, I promise I feel your pain.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Making the decision to separate and subsequently divorce (with a one-year-old son, at the time) was, without doubt, the hardest thing I’ve ever done. That was until I started trying to untangle and separate my life and make it my own again, because doing that, while simultaneously raising a child, earning a living and healing from a lot of trauma, was undoubtedly harder. So, if you’re at the start of the process, mid-split, buried in legal paperwork or generally feeling a bit blue about no longer being an ‘us’, here are some of my favourite things about being divorced. See you on the other side.</p><h2 data-node-id=2 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>1.You'll learn who you really are</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The chances are you’ll feel completely lost without your other half at first. But you get to fill the part of your personality they’ve always filled in with whatever you want. Don’t rush into another relationship, take your time and really get to know yourself and reinvent yourself at your own leisure, without trying to conform to anyone else’s expectations. You might even find out you’re pretty spectacular on your own, just as you are.</p><h2 data-node-id=5 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>2. You can now check the ‘Ms’ box on forms</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Rumour has it, when it was first introduced, the ‘Ms’ title was mostly used by 'difficult women' who refused to disclose whether they were married or not, nor to be defined by their marital status. And well-behaved women seldom make history, so I’ve heard. Plus, Ms has a mysterious (nay, ms-terious) ring to it, don’t you think?</p><img alt="'gloria bell' julianne moore" title="'Gloria Bell' Julianne Moore" width=6588 height=3294 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/gloria-bell-1605876727.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Fabula/Sony/Kobal/Shutterstock</span><p>Julianne Moore as a divorcée in Gloria Bell</p><h2 data-node-id=8 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>3. Prepare to find joy in living alone again</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Things are where you left them. Nobody cares if you leave the washing up until tomorrow. There are no wet towels left on the floor (unless you left them there). And that gloomy Sunday it rained all day and you felt too hungover to get dressed and wandered round in pants, a sweatshirt and bed socks all day eating toast and peanut butter? Nobody even knew.</p><h2 data-node-id=10 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>4. You can discover the joys of dating</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">You might never even have done it (I hadn’t). Now is your time to discover the thrill of dating apps, making eye contact with strangers and saying ‘yes’ to set-me-ups. OK, realistically the apps are hell, but once real-life resumes and you can get out into the world get used to saying ‘yes’ when someone asks you out or offers to buy you a drink. You can now make your married friends jealous with tales of your love affairs with penniless Parisian artists and cocktail dates that end in night-long city walks and watching the sunrise as they debate whether it feels like a Deliveroo or a pizza night. (Spoiler: getting takeaway is still fun once you’re divorced, and you don’t have to share.)</p><img alt="editorial use only no book cover usagemandatory credit photo by moviestoreshutterstock 1565786aeat pray love, julia roberts, javier bardemeat pray love 2010" title="Eat Pray Love - 2010" width=4722 height=3148 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/eat-pray-love-1605876889.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Moviestore/Shutterstock</span><p>Julia Roberts enjoys her post-divorce romance in Eat Pray Love</p><h2 data-node-id=13 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>5. Let’s talk about sex</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">While we’re on the topic of dating, let’s touch briefly and discreetly on the topic of sex. Forget everything you knew before. Now is the time to learn what you like and really enjoy exploring your sexuality without judgement or inhibitions.</p><h2 data-node-id=15 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>6. Divorce is funny (eventually)</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Yes, it hurts now, and laughing about your situation might feel a long way off, but you won't feel this pained and bereft forever. There will come a time when you'll make jokes about your inability to succeed in a marriage and your plans for marriages two, three and four and make everyone else feel uncomfortable. (Or is just me that does this?)</p><h2 data-node-id=17 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>7. Happy parents make happy children</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">This is one for the single parents out there. If you thought that children needed a nuclear set-up to thrive in life, prepare to be re-educated. Children need love, security and the occasional dippy egg. You know who is best at delivering love, support, security and perfectly-cooked dippy eggs? Parents who aren’t in unhappy, toxic relationships. Your kids will thrive as long as you do, too.</p><img alt="first wives club bette midler goldie hawn and diane keaton" title="First Wives Club Bette Midler Goldie Hawn And Diane Keaton" width=2112 height=1408 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/first-wives-club-1605877048.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><a rel=noopener href=# class="pinterest css-1i6sckr e1c1bym14"><img data-dynamic-svg=true src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.harpersbazaar.com/_assets/design-tokens/fre/static/icons/social/pinterest.e8cf655.svg?primary=%2523ffffff" data-testid=dynamic-svg-base height=auto width=auto alt=pinterest style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Getty Images</span><p>Bette Midler, Goldie Hawn and Diane Keaton in The First Wives Club</p><h2 data-node-id=20 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>8. You will find out who your friends are (and will make a few more)</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=21 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The chances are you might lose a few shared friends in the divorce. Others might also drop off and invites from married friends might dry up. Out with old, in with the new. Going through a divorce has made my friendships with my school friends stronger than ever and I’ve picked up the most wonderful crew of single mum friends through <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://frolo.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Frolo app" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">the Frolo app</a>, many of whom are fellow glamorous divorcée-types.</p><h2 data-node-id=22 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>9. You will emerge stronger and wiser</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Before I got divorced, everything had followed the life script I’d written for myself. Once everything fell apart and I picked myself up, brushed myself off and built a bigger, brighter, happier life for myself I realised that there is no need to be afraid of failure. It will be the making of you.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">In need of some at-home inspiration? <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=szpklLhpWonj6JnlBH3GzpALHvm1ZwMa0oU9UEP6sYg4RDPmqEfyeN1vIR80j83YlJMODbnaXySUsa" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Sign up to our free weekly newsletter" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Sign up to our free weekly newsletter</a> for skincare and self-care, the latest cultural hits to read and download, and the little luxuries that make staying in so much more satisfying.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=25 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=szpklLhpWonj6JnlBH3GzpALHvm1ZwMa0oU9UEP6sYg4RDPmqEfyeN1vIR80j83YlJMODbnaXySUsa" data-vars-ga-call-to-action="SIGN UP" rel=nofollow data-href="https://hearst.emsecure.net/optiext/cr.aspx?ID=szpklLhpWonj6JnlBH3GzpALHvm1ZwMa0oU9UEP6sYg4RDPmqEfyeN1vIR80j83YlJMODbnaXySUsa" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink class="body-btn-link css-lihu0l emevuu60"><strong>SIGN UP</strong></a><br></p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qa3RqZyrq5KWx6Kt0WeaqKVfqrhws9Sim55nkWiBeH%2BXbm5tZ2liv6at0qilrGWkpHqnscSlZKmno57BqsLEZpibp6Wperq71KtknaGmpL%2BksY4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
