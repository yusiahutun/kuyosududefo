A 1969 graduate of West Jones High School in Laurel, Elaine found her lifelong love in Dale A. Holifield, whom she married on Sept. 5, 1969. Their love story spanned an incredible 54 years and became an inspiration to all who knew them. Her passion for education led her to achieve a bachelor's degree in education from the University of Southern Mississippi in 1988, after which she obtained a master's degree in education. For 22 years, she served as a devoted teacher in the Jones County school system, touching the lives of countless students. Elaine's faith in God was unwavering, and she was a proud member of the Baptist community. In her retirement years, she cherished the simple pleasures — observing the beauty of wildlife, reading countless books and spending time with her family.</span></p><p><span>Elaine's legacy lives on through the love she shared with her family. She was preceded in death by her father Jack Taylor.&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p><span>She is survived by her devoted husband Dale Holifield of Gallatin, Mo., who stood by her side for more than five decades.

She is also survived by her caring siblings Linda Hosey (Ricky) of Soso and Jackie Taylor (Teresa) of Soso; brother-in-law Don Holifield of Laurel; along with her fur babies Cookie and MJ, who brought immeasurable joy into her life. Numerous nieces, nephews and extended family members also mourn her passing.</span></p><p><span>A graveside service will be held at 9 a.m. Saturday, Oct. 7, on the family farm (150 Heyser Lane, Gallatin, MO 64640).&nbsp;The family will gather with friends from 7-8 p.m., Friday at the funeral home.
