These days, Silicon Slopes is synonymous with an innovative and exciting tech hub that’s easily on par with the likes of Silicon Valley.</p><p>In case you haven’t heard, the Silicon Slopes refer to the <a href=# rel=noopener>utah tech</a> hub in Salt Lake City that’s fast becoming the best tech hub in the world. The Silicon Slopes include Park City, Provo, Midvale, and surrounding areas.</p><p>According to a Sleek Capital study of all 50 states, Utah easily ranks number one as the best state for startups in America in Tech Hub.</p><p>Read on to see why the Silicon Slopes in Salt Lake City attract so many entrepreneurs and startups.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. An Enormous Tech Boom</h3><p>Although the evolution of the Silicon Slopes may seem sudden, it didn’t come out of nowhere. In fact, the growth that put it on the map as a major Tech hub for the tech industry was years in the making.</p><p>The Utah tech industry has roots that go all the way back to the 1970s when tech giants like WordPerfect, Novell, and Evans & Sutherland paved the way. After the 1970s, the industry slowed down – only to pick right back up again in the late 1990s and early 2000s when companies like Ancestry.com, Vivint, and Omniture arrived on the scene.</p><p>In fact, it was Omniture’s acquisition by Adobe in 2009 that pushed Adobe to set up a permanent base in Utah.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>2. Cheap Real Estate and a Lower Cost of Living</h3><p>When you compare real estate prices in Silicon Valley to real estate in Utah, it becomes clear why many of the most <a href=#>innovative tech companies</a> have made Salt Lake City their home. Startups in Silicon Slopes can build massive offices to house their growing workforce for a fraction of the cost.</p><p>The monetary impact of jazzing up an office with gyms, cafeterias, and other luxury amenities in Utah is negligible – which is also why tech companies here can attract and retain top talent.</p><p>Because Utah also has plenty of affordable housing, employees come from all over the U.S. to enjoy a lower cost of living. <a href=# rel=noopener>CompTIA</a>, an IT trade association, reported that Utah had the highest increase in tech jobs from 2016 to 2017.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. A Deep Talent Pool</h3><p>Another reason Utah has enjoyed an unprecedented tech industry boom is due to the education of the people who reside there. “Utahns” – as they are known colloquially – have one of the highest numbers of tech degrees per capita.</p><p>Most degree-holders in the tech talent pool graduated from Utah State, the University of Utah, and Brigham Young. The deep talent pool in Utah provides a significant advantage for startups because they don’t have to look out-of-state for employees.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Final Words</h2><p>The Utah tech Hub is booming, and it’s not showing any signs of slowing down soon. With top talent and a low cost of living, everyone in the tech industry wants to ride the wave and contribute to the next generation of innovation.</p><p>The Silicon Slopes have captured the interest of entrepreneurs, startups, and investors who are grabbing the opportunity with both hands – it’s not hard to see why.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismJqyr8DEq6eroaOaxLC%2By51lnKedZL%2BmrdKopaxlpamuqXnIrGSaZaSasKl5x66ZZp6fp3q0wMCrq66oow%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
