So, here we are with all the answers you need. As Messi and Ronaldo are both known for their healthy lifestyle this comes as a shock to many. So, let’s check how credible the pictures are.</p><h2 id=65fd5f18276d3><strong>Is Viral Image Of Cristiano Ronaldo And Lionel Messi Smoking Cigars Together Real?&nbsp;</strong></h2><p>A photo of famed footballers Cristiano Ronaldo and Lionel Messi, smoking cigars has appeared on the internet. We discovered a few inconsistencies in the image after extensively inspecting it. If the photo is a selfie, it is unclear who is holding the camera because they are both holding cigars with one hand and the other hand on each other's side. Meanwhile, the smoke on Messi's lips seems to overlap with Ronaldo’s smoke. <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><p>We then searched for 'Man Meets Machine' on Instagram (@manmeetsmachine) and discovered numerous AI-generated photos of celebrities including Donald Trump, the Pope, Drake, and Elon Musk. The handle's bio states that the content provided is AI-generated or photoshopped, with the phrase "Nothing Is Real Ai & Photoshop Madness".</p><p>For more than a decade, the individual duel between Ronaldo and Messi has been the defining element of modern football. Messi surpassed Ronaldo in the Ballon d'Or race with his sixth win in 2019, and he consolidated his lead with his seventh in 2021 and eighth in 2023.</p><p>But Ronaldo and Messi smoking cigars was too much. Both men highly promote good and healthy lifestyles. So, beware of such fake posts. Many on social media are creating fake posts using AI, and dragging big names into the dirt. So, always check before blindly believing in what you see on social media.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7sbXNpK2ipJyWe6S7zGiqqaeiqcBwssCcq2abmJqwrHnIrGSvoaKWuW61zJqenmWfm3qkvsisq6KZnqR6s7vNmqOdp12Wu6V5y6Kmp52cYrqmv9KiZKyln6C2r7OMnKCgmaKoerW7xp6roZ2iYr%2BmrctmnLGonKS%2FqrrGZqOarJWowW6%2B1KamrqpdZn95hJVvbg%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
