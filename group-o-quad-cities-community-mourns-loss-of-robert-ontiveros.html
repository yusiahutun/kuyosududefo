These efforts included West Gateway Partners and Mercado on Fifth — an open-air night market in Moline’s Floreciente neighborhood that features live entertainment, food trucks, and local vendors.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/02/Bob-O.png><p>Additionally, Ontiveros served as a trustee of Augustana and was an active member of both the Illinois and U.S. Hispanic Chambers of Commerce, along with other community and business organizations, such as Boys & Girls Club of the Mississippi Valley and Junior Achievement.</p><p>The <a href=#>Greater Quad Cities Hispanic Chamber of Commerce</a> — which Ontiveros founded — honored him Wednesday morning in a Facebook post:</p><p>“Bob worked tirelessly to raise money for our annual gala and found long-lasting partnerships for us along the way. When he founded us in 2008, he welcomed guests and shared examples of how he benefited and succeeded in his own business by joining the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce and the Illinois Hispanic Chamber of Commerce,” the group said.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.ourquadcities.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/19/2022/02/Bob-O3.jpg><p>“He invited Hispanic owned businesses and professionals to play active roles in the creation of the first steps to be taken by the Greater Quad Cities Hispanic Chamber of Commerce. It is through Bob’s vision and passion that the Hispanic Chamber can support, promote, and enhance the growth and success of businesses and organizations by leveraging assets, contributions, and expertise of our unique Hispanic and multicultural identities today.</p><p>“Bob was a strong community leader, a kindhearted person, and a visionary,” the Hispanic Chamber wrote. “He shaped and changed our community to what it is today; for his impact has forever changed the Quad Cities area and beyond. We are grateful to have been a part of his journey and we will continue to work towards his dream of a world where there is equality in business.”</p><p>“As a business leader and philanthropist to our community, Bob Ontiveros made our region a better place,” United Way Quad Cities posted on LinkedIn. “His dedication to family and community will leave a lasting impact. Our hearts go out to all those who knew him, especially his granddaughter, Maria, who is a board member for United Way.
