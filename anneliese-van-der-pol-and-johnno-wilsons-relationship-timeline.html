I think I was a little too old. I had just missed it, which was good because then I was not as nervous to talk to [Anneliese] on set,” Wilson said during an October 2023 episode of van der Pol’s <a href=# rel=noopener>“Big Name B*tches”</a> podcast. “And immediately, we just hit it off.”</p><p class=p1>According to Wilson, about “halfway through” his first week on set, he wished he “could ask Anneliese out” on a date despite dating another woman at the time.</p><p class=p1>Several months later, Wilson ended his preexisting relationship before asking van der Pol out on a date at the <i>Raven’s Home </i>season 1 wrap party. After five years of dating, they got engaged.</p><p class=p1>“We got together, and we’ve never looked back. I’m so happy.

According to van der Pol, Wilson was “kind of flirting [her] up” in between takes. (The TV pilot aired on Disney Channel in July.)</p><p class=p1>“[My preexisting relationship] was on the outs for a long, long time,” Wilson said on “Big Name B*tches” in October. “I was coming in [to film] for three weeks over an 8-month period when I would see Anneliese, and we just had a good rapport. … But then, after the third episode, I didn’t see her for several months, and in that time I broke it off [with my ex].”</p><h3 class=p3><b>October 2017</b></h3><p class=p1>Two months later, Wilson was invited to the <i>Raven’s Home </i>season 1 wrap party and reconnected with van der Pol.</p><p class=p1>“I was looking for [Anneliese], and she was completely avoiding me,” Wilson added on the 2023 podcast episode. “I was like, ‘Hey Anneliese,’ and she goes, ‘Where’s your girlfriend?’”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Anneliese-van-der-Pol-and-Johnno-Wilson-s-Relationship-Timeline-inine-2.jpg><p class=p1>Van der Pol, meanwhile, was nervous since she “really liked” Wilson but thought he was in another relationship. Wilson told her that he was single “right away.”</p><h3 class=p3><b>March 2020</b></h3><p class=p1>Van der Pol took their romance <a href=# rel=noopener>Instagram</a> official nearly three years later. “He’s my ex-husband and I HATE him, but apparently YOU love him … so here ya freaking go. THE WHOLE VIDEO … <span class=s1>🙄🤣</span>,” van der Pol wrote via Instagram, sharing a video of Wilson playing with facial filters.</p><h3>Thank You!</h3><p>You have successfully subscribed.</p><h3 class=p3><b>August 2023</b></h3><p class=p1>Van der Pol frequently joked about her relationship — and a potential engagement timeline — via TikTok. In <a href=# rel=noopener>August</a>, she enlisted Wilson to recreate a scene from <i>That’s So Raven</i>. The pair lip-synched a moment from season 3 in which van der Pol’s Chelsea mistakenly called her then-boyfriend Danny by the name “Randy.” Wilson took on the role of Danny.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.usmagazine.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/Anneliese-van-der-Pol-and-Johnno-Wilson-s-Relationship-Timeline-inline-1.jpg><h3 class=p3><b>December 2023</b></h3><p class=p1>Wilson <a href=# rel=noopener>proposed</a> on December 23 in front of a decorated Christmas tree.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tr%2FMmp6aspmjsm%2BvzqZmnJ2cmq%2BztdOyZKedp6h8r7HWrGaapp6auaqx0p5kr5meYrGmvoyppqVlkaOxbrbOoaWnp12stq2%2FzqeqZqqVoa61tc6nqqGhoGLBqrnEpaCnnV8%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
