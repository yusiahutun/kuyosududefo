Meanwhile, the Texans were hard at work proving naysayers wrong last weekend during the <a href=# data-type=post data-id=1695174 rel="noreferrer noopener">NFL’s Wild Card round</a>, defeating the Cleveland Browns in a commanding 45-14 victory led by star rookie quarterback C.J.

He added, “I don’t think anybody’s ever requested not to have the bye when they earned it, so it’s definitely a positive. I think our guys looked at it that way and we had a really good week of practice, so we did what we needed to do.”</p><p>Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson, who is up for MVP status alongside Houston’s Stroud, is looking forward to getting back to the field. “We had some time off to regroup, lock back in,” Jackson told reporters on January 16, per <a href=# rel=nofollow>AP</a>. “I’m hype. Antsy.” As for Stroud, the young star is ready for a rematch after his team’s Week 1 loss against the Ravens back in September 2023.&nbsp;</p><p>“I think we’ve grown in a multitude of areas,” Stroud said in a press conference, according to <a href=# data-type=link data-id=https://www.nbcsports.com/nfl/profootballtalk/rumor-mill/news/c-j-stroud-weve-grown-in-a-lot-of-places-since-facing-the-ravens-in-week-1 rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">NBC Sports</a>. “I think at that point, we weren’t really identified as who we are now, and we’ve grown in a lot of aspects. A lot more experience up front now, both offensively, defensively, and special teams, so I think we’ve grown in a lot of places.”</p><p>Now, the anticipation is palpable as the Ravens return to the postseason battleground, aiming to extend their impressive run. On the other hand, the Texans, riding the momentum of their Wild Card win, are hoping to continue their underdog journey. All that remains to be seen is who will make it to the next round of the NFL playoffs—and for that, you’re going to need to know how to watch the Ravens game vs Texans live for free.
