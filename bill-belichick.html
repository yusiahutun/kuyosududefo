He was born and raised in Nashville, Tennessee.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bill’s father, Steve Belichick, was a famous football player turned to coach. He played for&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Detroit Lions</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;during his adult days. However, Steve was a prominent coach for&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Hiram College’s&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>football team.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bill-belichick-childhood-300x229.jpg><p>There is no known information about Bill’s mother. Although some rumors are claiming, she worked as an assistant with his father.</p><p>Bill’s parents share a Croatian heritage. His grandparents migrated to the United States from a small town in Croatia during the industrialization period.</p><p>It’s sad to say that his parents are no more in this world. Bill’s father, Steve, died on 15 November 2005. And mother Jeanette passed away in September 2020.</p><h3>Bill Belichick | Education</h3><p>Belichick completed his primary schooling in his hometown. From primary school, Bellichik started to work with his father in the club. He used to go to school, and in the holidays, he used to learn coaching techniques with his father.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bill and his family went to Annapolis, Maryland. There, his father began to work as an assistant coach.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bill got named after&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>College Football Hall of Fame</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;coach&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bill Edwards</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>. Edwards is his godfather.</span></p><p>Similarly, Belichick went to Andover, Massachusetts, for a university degree. He graduated from the Philips Academy with improvisation in his grades.</p><p><strong>Also, read this <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Joachim Low Bio: Age, Salary, Wife, Germany, Coach Wiki</a>.</strong></p><p>After some time, Bill enrolled for a degree in economics. He completed his degree from Weyslan University, Middletown. There he started to work as an assistant with the head coach, Ted Marchibroda.</p><h2>Bill Belichick | Coaching Career</h2><p>Belichick worked in his college football team. There he learned to practice defensive coaching. Belichick progressed in a short period because he had learned many things from his father – and godfather.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Belichick-with-Patriots-Hoodie-300x200.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bill did not work in the college’s team. Instead, he started to search for jobs in the NFL teams. He approached the </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Detroit Lions</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true> – where his father used to play. And Belichick also requested a career in the&nbsp;</span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Denver Broncos</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>.</span></p><h3>Work with the New York Giants</h3><p>Despite his enthusiasm, Bill’s dream of getting a job in the NFL teams did not work. After approaching so many clubs and managers, in 1979, the New York Giants finally hired him.</p><p>The team management recruited Bill as a defensive coordinator and worked under the head coach <strong>Bill Parcells</strong>. Parcells was a Super Bowl-winning coach.</p><p>Bill stayed in the Giants for 12 seasons.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bill-in-new-york-giants-221x300.jpg><p>Under his defensive coordination, the Giants gained the Super Bowl in 1986 and 1990. Likewise, Bill’s popularity grew more robust, and he was offered a job in several NFL clubs. Bill worked with the Giants for eleven years. Then, in 1990, he left the Giants.</p><h3>Contract with Cleveland Browns</h3><p>After winning two Super Bowls, Bill was no more a defensive coordinator. The team management of the <strong>Cleveland Browns&nbsp;</strong>appointed him as their head coach. He worked in the Browns for four years.</p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>During his tenure, Belichick was successful in getting the Browns into playoff victory for the first time. Against the&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>New England Patriots,&nbsp;</span><span data-preserver-spaces=true>the team made victory.</span></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/bill-with-cleveland-175x300.jpg><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Belichick got criticized after selling their primary quarterback </span><strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bernie Kosar</span></strong><span data-preserver-spaces=true>&nbsp;in the middle of the season. Kosar moved to the Dallas Cowboys, and the team acquired the Super Bowl in the same season.</span></p><p>After the incident, Belichick’s reputation on the club declined. He approached other clubs for coaching. Instead, the management of the Browns fired him in 1996.</p><h3>Bill Belichick’s Career After 1996</h3><p>Belichick signed a contract with the New England Patriots as assistant head coach. His ex-boss Bill Parcells was the head coach for the Patriots. Bill worked under him again.</p><p>The Patriots won the AFC championship. But they lost in the Super Bowl with Green Bay Packers. Overall, with this record, Bill’s work as an assistant coach was satisfying.</p><p>However, Bill’s interest in work declined in the Patriots. After a year, he decided to leave the club. It’s unknown why he left the club. But media reports claim he wanted to be the head coach, so he decided to go.</p><h4>Tenure with the New York Jets</h4><p>In 1997, Bill moved to the New York Jets. But again, the Jets’ management signed him as an assistant coach and defensive coordinator.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/10/belichick-in-the-jets.jpg><p>It’s funny to say that Bill left the Patriots having some bitterness with Bill Parcells. However, the team’s committee forced him to work under Parcells.</p><p><strong>Also, read <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Jenn Sterger Bio: Early Life, Career, Controversy, Social Media</a>.</strong></p><p>Amid the bitterness with Parcells, Bill worked with the Jets for two years. Moreover, Bill got contacted by the Patriots to become their head coach. After some time, Jet’s management agreed to give Bill some settlement.</p><h4>Back Again with the Patriots</h4><p>With an agreement, Bill got hired as the head coach of the Patriots in 2000. The owner of the club handed full responsibility for the club.</p><p>After that, Bill hasn’t stopped doing extraordinary things for the club. He has made numerous records while coaching for the patriots.</p><p>From 2000-2020, Belichick has earned six Super Bowls. This record is only entitled to two other coaches. Bill’s glorious career made the Patriots one of the most valuable teams in the NFL.</p><p>According to Bill:</p><p>“Mental Toughness is doing the right thing for the team when it’s not the best thing for you”</p><p>Similarly, Bill also led the Patriots for three consecutive Super Bowls in four years. He is the only coach in the NFL to do so.</p><p>Nowadays, Americans celebrate Bill as a living legend. He has also received a prestigious award from the President of the United States during a ceremony.</p><h2>Bill Belichick | Book</h2><p>Bill is not only recognized all over the world through his coaching career and has a number of fans worldwide.

He has named the boat “VII Rings” after winning a total of seven super bowls. Later on, again, after winning the super bowl, the boat got its new name.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/playersbio.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/Bill-V-Rings-Boat-300x271.jpg><p>Bill Boat’s name changes according to time and often. It is also said that he donated his V Rings powerboat to sail Newport in 2017.</p><h2>Bill Belichick | Medal of Freedom</h2><p>The medal of freedom is especially given for meritorious contribution. It may be anything from security or national interest of US, world peace or cultural or any other significant public or private endeavors.</p><p>Bill, in the beginning, was ready to accept this award, but later on, he decided not to receive the award.</p><p>He threw an official statement and told that:</p><p>Recently, I was offered the opportunity to receive the Presidential Medal of Freedom, which I was flattered by out of respect for what the honor represents and admiration for prior recipients,” the Patriots’ head coach said in a statement.</p><p>“Subsequently, the tragic events of last week occurred, and the decision has been made not to move forward with the award.</p><p>“Above all, I am an American citizen with great reverence for our nation’s values, freedom, and democracy. I know I also represent my family and the New England Patriots team.</p><p>“One of the most rewarding things in my professional career took place in 2020 when, through the great leadership within our team, conversations about social justice, equality, and human rights moved to the forefront and became actions. Continuing those efforts while remaining true to the people, team, and country I love outweigh the benefits of any individual award.”</p><h2>Bill Belichick | Personal Life, Wife, and Kids</h2><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>Bill and his ex-wife, <a href=#>Debby Clarke</a>, separated in 2006. There is no known information about <a href=#>Debby Clarke</a> and her occupation.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>The couple has three children; Amanda, Stephen, and Brian.

Whereas his two sons, Stephen and Brian, are involved with the Patriots.</span></p><p><span data-preserver-spaces=true>He is residing in a house in Hingham, Massachusetts, due to Covid-19.
