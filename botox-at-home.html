You may be wondering if it’s time to look into Botox. Sure, it’s one of the most common nonsurgical plastic surgery procedures, but the invasive injections — which entail a doctor administering toxins directly into the facial muscles to paralyze them and restrict movement — are costly and don’t come without some risk. Not to mention, it eventually wears off and requires repeat treatments, often several times per year.&nbsp;The good news for you? These drawbacks have prompted a movement to figure out other ways to get the same effects without visiting the doctor (some have even coined the term <a href=# rel=noopener>notox</a>). Some of these “Botox at home” remedies, popping up all over social media, are even better than the pricey wrinkle shots! Keep scrolling to learn more.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>What remedies work like Botox at home?</h2><p>A bevy of “Botox at home” remedies are now being touted on social media so you can get the wrinkle-smoothing results, no doctors or needles involved.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>1. Botox at home: Flaxseed mask</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/GettyImages-1476824163.jpg><p>“Flaxseeds and water” has garnered more than six million views on <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok, </a>and users call it one of the best natural methods to mimic Botox at home, saying it’s the quickest way to glass-like skin. And while there are no real scientific studies on applying flaxseed topically to the skin, doctors say the claims have some merit. “Flaxseed can promote new cell turnover, increase collagen and tighten the face through their antioxidant powers. Additionally, it helps prevent acne by regulating excess sebum production,” explains <a href=# rel=noopener>Konstantin Vasyukevich, MD</a>, plastic surgeon and facelift expert.&nbsp;</p><p>And flaxseed masks are just one of the many popular viral <a href=# rel=noopener>fixes for wrinkles</a>, fine lines and glowing skin. One way to get the Botox at home results? With a flaxseed and water mask seen here on TikTok’s <a href=# rel=noopener>@brooke.therat</a>. She says her skin felt more hydrated after using a slimy mixture of flaxseeds and water in the video that’s garnered more than 4 million views.&nbsp;</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>&nbsp;</h3><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@brooke.therat href=#>@brooke.therat</a><p>Most people I’ve seen do a video on this mask already have “glass skin”, so let me show you the flax seed mask on my skin that has really been struggling the past few months, especially on my forehead and cheeks. <a title=flaxseed href=#>#flaxseed</a> <a title=flaxseedmask href=#>#flaxseedmask</a> <a title=flaxseedgel href=#>#flaxseedgel</a> <a title=flaxseedbenefits href=#>#flaxseedbenefits</a> <a title=diyskincare href=#>#diyskincare</a></p><a title="♬ original sound - brooke.therat" href=#>♬ original sound – brooke.therat</a></figure><p>“Flaxseeds are a superfood rich in omega-3 fatty acids and antioxidants, and when applied topically, can hydrate your skin and impact anti-inflammatory properties. The mask also produces a feeling of tightness, which helps to eliminate fine lines and wrinkles,” says esthetician <a href=# rel=noopener>Mila Davis</a> of <a href=#>Skin to Smile.</a>&nbsp;</p><p>However, Davis notes that the effects of the mask are temporary, with only short-lived improvements to the skin — but it is safe to use up to twice a day.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Are Flaxseed Masks the New Botox?

Argireline peptide serum</h3><p>YouTuber <a href=# rel=noopener>@MadAboutSkin</a> calls this $9 serum “Botox in a Bottle” (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from The Ordinary, $9.40</a>). It uses peptides to target dynamic fine lines like crow’s feet around the eyes. Research has shown many benefits to incorporating specific peptides into your skincare routine.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>In England, a study showed that peptides can penetrate the tough stratum corneum, or the skin barrier — and <a href=# rel=noopener>potentially reverse the signs of aging</a>. Argireline is one such peptide.&nbsp;</p><p>“Argireline is a synthetic peptide with a primary mechanism of action focused on inhibiting the release of acetylcholine, a small molecule responsible for muscle contraction. By preventing the contraction of muscles, this serum helps to relax facial muscles and reduce the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles,” attests Davis.&nbsp;</p><p>“This mechanism of action is very close to the actions of actual Botox and makes it a very effective at-home remedy for reducing the appearance of fine lines and wrinkles. Reducing repeated muscle movements can also help prevent the formation of new lines and wrinkles while minimizing the appearance of existing lines and wrinkles,” she adds.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Some studies have also suggested that this product can <a href=# rel=noopener>stimulate collagen and elastin production</a>, resulting in a more youthful appearance.</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=#>Dermatologist Weighs In On $20 TikTok Peptide Trick That Works Like Botox</a></strong></p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>3. Botox at home: Silicone patches</h3><p>“Silicone patches are usually applied to your skin overnight and help reduce fine lines and wrinkles with several different mechanisms of action. The patches help to lock in moisture, which results in improved hydration and elasticity of the skin,” says Davis.&nbsp;</p><p>Silicone patches can also help the absorption of other active ingredients applied before their placement, enhancing the benefits of your skincare products and producing anti-aging benefits. “The patches also act as a physical barrier to making certain facial movements and therefore limit your ability to contract the facial muscles; limiting repetitive facial movements during sleeping hours can prevent the formation of new fine lines and wrinkles and have a temporary smoothing effect on existing fine lines and wrinkles,” Davis adds.&nbsp;</p><p>YouTuber <a href=# rel=noopener>Darnell Cox</a> of Live Young Lifestyle explains in the video below how medical-grade anti-wrinkle patches — like Frownies (<a href=# rel="noopener sponsored nofollow">Buy from Amazon, $24.95</a>) — hydrate skin, stimulate collagen and soften fine lines and wrinkles.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Related: <a href=# rel=noopener>A $24 Botox Dupe Called Frownies Just Might Put a Smile On *Your* Face</a></strong></p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>4. Matrixyl peptide serum&nbsp;</h3><p>​​Matrixyl is another peptide found in many skincare products due to its ability to stimulate collagen production. “Collagen is essential in keeping our skin plump and youthful. As we age, we lose collagen, forming deeper facial lines and wrinkles. Matrixyl effectively increases collagen production, resulting in a more youthful appearance,” attests Davis.&nbsp;</p><p>You can use this in conjunction with Argireline for an extra powerful peptide punch.&nbsp;</p><p>TikToker <a href=# rel=noopener>@SarahPalmyra</a> shows off the before and after results that will “blow you away.”&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-tiktok wp-block-embed-tiktok"><a title=@sarahpalmyra href=#>@sarahpalmyra</a><p>Reply to @e.michele7 <a title=botox href=#>#botox</a> <a title=beforeandafter href=#>#beforeandafter</a> <a title=skincarehack href=#>#skincarehack</a> <a title=antiaging href=#>#antiaging</a> <a title=tutorials href=#>#tutorials</a> <a title=theordinary href=#>#theordinary</a></p><a title="♬ Spongebob Tomfoolery - Dante9k Remix - David Snell" href=#>♬ Spongebob Tomfoolery – Dante9k Remix – David Snell</a></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>5. Botox at home: Silk pillowcases</h3><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.firstforwomen.com/wp-content/uploads/sites/2/2024/12/GettyImages-1423015574-1.jpg><p>Beauty pros have touted silk pillowcases as the secret to looking younger overnight. Silk or satin pillowcases purportedly reduce the appearance of sleep lines and the swelling to your face while you sleep because it absorbs less moisture than other common bedding materials like cotton or polyester — which means skin stays more hydrated and plump. (Click through for more <a href=# rel=noopener>beauty benefits of silk pillowcases</a>.)</p><p>“The pillowcase reduces the pressure and friction your face makes with the pillow during sleeping hours, resulting in fewer sleep lines and wrinkles. The silk and satin are also gentler on your skin and can reduce irritation and inflammation, especially in people with sensitive skin,” says Davis.&nbsp;Plus: According to the Sleep Foundation, silk pillowcases can alsohelp your<a href=# rel=noopener> night creams be much more effective</a> since the material won’t absorb the products like other pillowcases can.&nbsp;</p><p>A silk pillowcase might be worthwhile, especially if you’re a side or face sleeper or toss and turn a lot. No matter how you sleep, you spend an average of 8 hours with your face and hair pressed against your pillow — which is inevitably doing some unwanted damage.</p><p><a href=# rel=noopener>Mattress Nerd</a> took to YouTube to show all the benefits of silky beauty pillows while you sleep.&nbsp;</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio"></figure><p>First For Women aims to feature only the best products and services.
