They kept liking each other’s posts on Instagram through October 2015. They were first seen together in late November 2015, however, relationship was confirmed only in December, when they were papped holding hands and Louis even stayed at Danielle’s house in Chicago. They were seen kissing in early January 2016, during a trip to France.<br>Louis’ baby momma Briana Jungwirth dissed Danielle on twitter after Danielle was papped with Louis and Briana’s son Freddie at the beach. Louis and Danielle also were part of an scandal when Danielle was papped topless while they were on a trip to Mexico in May 2016.<br>It seems they have split just weeks after Louis lost his mother who passed away. They were seen together for the last time on December 24, 2016, when Danielle spent Christmas Eve and Louis’ birthday with him and his family. They presumably broke up a few days later, since they didn’t spend New Year’s Eve together. Danielle was even spotted holding hands with another man during the New Year’s.<br>Louis and Danielle’s break-up was confirmed by their reps on January 19, 2017.<br>A source said: “Louis and Danielle have made the decision to split up but they are still going to be mates. They’re still talking to each other and there is no bad feeling whatsoever.”<br>“It’s really sad because Danielle has been there for Louis through this horrible time. She has stood by him, remained loyal and continued to be a great support, which is exactly what he needs.”<br>“Sometimes these things just don’t work out and for Louis and Danielle this was the best way forward.”<br>Although the source claimed they remained as friends, Louis and Danielle unfollowed each other on social media after their split.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7uLTOrJuarJWZxKm7jZympmeUlsGqusZoo6itmah6tbvMpaCnq5%2BjeqK6w2abmqaZmrmtsYycmKaokpq5rQ%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
