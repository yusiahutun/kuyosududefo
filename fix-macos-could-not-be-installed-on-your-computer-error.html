Hopefully, the error message told you exactly what the problem is. That way, you know where to target your troubleshooting efforts.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/macOS-Could-Not-Be-Installed-on-Your-Computer-Error-Message.jpg><p>Some of the most common reasons macOS can't complete the installation include:</p><ul><li>The path /System/Installation/Packages/OSInstall.mpkg appears to be missing or damaged</li><li>Not enough free storage on your Mac</li><li>Corruptions in the macOS installer file</li><li>Problems with your Mac's startup disk</li><li>Incompatible hardware</li></ul><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Whatever the cause of your macOS installation error, it's usually easy to fix for yourself. Follow the tips below to sort out the issue.</p><h2 id=before-troubleshooting-your-macos-installation-error>Before Troubleshooting Your macOS Installation Error</h2><p>If your macOS installation couldn't be completed, you might find yourself stuck in a loop where the installer reopens every time you restart your computer. Follow these quick steps to break out of that loop and protect your data before troubleshooting the error.</p><h3 id=step-1-boot-up-your-mac-in-safe-mode>Step 1. Boot Up Your Mac in Safe Mode</h3><p>Safe Mode stops various programs from launching upon startup, including the macOS installer. Booting your Mac in Safe Mode breaks you out of any startup loops and stops troublesome programs from running in the background.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>The instructions for using Safe Mode vary depending on whether you have an <a href=#>Intel or Apple silicon chip</a> in your Mac.</p><p>To boot into Safe Mode on an Intel-based computer, restart your Mac and hold down the <strong>Shift</strong> key while it powers on. Release the key when you see the Apple logo or hear a startup sound. It should say <strong>Safe Boot</strong> in the menu bar on the login screen.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/12/Safe-Boot-text-from-login-screen-e1579787973347.jpg><p>On an Apple silicon computer, shut down your Mac, then press and hold the Power button until the startup options screen appears. From here, select your <strong>Startup Disk</strong>, hold the <strong>Shift</strong> key, then click <strong>Continue in Safe Mode</strong>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=step-2-create-a-new-backup-using-time-machine>Step 2. Create a New Backup Using Time Machine</h3><p>It's always important to back up your Mac before installing a major macOS update. These updates edit the core files in your operating system, so if something goes wrong you might need to completely erase your Mac to fix it.</p><p>Connect an external drive and <a href=#>use Time Machine to back up your Mac</a>. Time Machine is the simplest way to protect all your data in incremental backups. These allow you to restore files from particular dates instead of keeping only the latest version of everything.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=step-3-check-your-mac-39-s-compatibility-in-the-app-store>Step 3. Check Your Mac's Compatibility in the App Store</h3><p>Before getting started with our troubleshooting tips, take a moment to make sure the latest version of macOS is compatible with your Mac.</p><p>Visit <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">this page</a> on Apple's support website and click the link for the macOS version you want to install to view its hardware requirements. Click the <strong>Apple</strong> logo in the menu bar and select <strong>About This Mac</strong> to compare those requirements to your Mac.</p><p>If your Mac isn't compatible, you can't install that macOS version upgrade. It might be the first of many <a href=#>signs that it's time to replace your Mac</a>.</p><h2 id=what-to-do-when-the-macos-installation-couldn-39-t-be-completed>What to Do When the macOS Installation Couldn't Be Completed</h2><p>Now that you've backed up your Mac and made sure it's compatible with the latest version of macOS, it's time to try fixing your installation error with the troubleshooting tips below.</p><p>Since there are so many potential causes to this macOS error, any one of these suggestions might fix the problem. We'll start with the quickest and easiest tips to save you as much time as possible.</p><h3 id=restart-your-mac-and-retry-the-installation>1. Restart Your Mac and Retry the Installation</h3><p>Sometimes, all you need to do to fix macOS errors is to restart your Mac and try again. Open the <strong>Apple</strong> menu and select <strong>Restart</strong> from the dropdown menu to do so.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Restart-Mac-confirmation-window.jpg><p>If your Mac is unresponsive, press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button to force a shutdown. Don't do this while the installation is in progress, though, since doing so can corrupt the files in your operating system.</p><h3 id=set-your-mac-to-the-correct-date-and-time>2. Set Your Mac to the Correct Date and Time</h3><p>It's possible that the date or time on your Mac is wrong. When this is the case, it can lead to problems connecting to Apple's servers, which might be the reason there was an error installing macOS.</p><p>Open the <strong>System Preferences</strong> and go to <strong>Date & Time</strong> to correct it. Click the <strong>Padlock</strong> and enter your administrator password, then choose to <strong>Set date and time automatically</strong>.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/Date-and-Time-automatic-option-in-System-Preferences.jpg><h3 id=create-enough-free-space-for-macos-to-install>3. Create Enough Free Space for macOS to Install</h3><p>A typical macOS installer takes up around 4–5GB of space on your Mac. But to complete a macOS installation, your computer actually needs about 20GB of free storage.</p><p>This is because the macOS installer needs extra space to unpack files and folders. Without that additional free space, the installer has no room to work and can't complete the installation on your Mac.</p><p>Open the <strong>Apple</strong> menu and go to <strong>About This Mac > Storage</strong> to view the free space on your Mac. Click <strong>Manage Storage</strong> to see what's using the most space and then follow our tips to <a href=#>free up more storage on your Mac</a>.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><h3 id=download-a-new-copy-of-the-macos-installer>4. Download a New Copy of the macOS Installer</h3><p>The macOS installer on your Mac may have become corrupt somehow. It's a good idea to move that installer to the Trash and download a new one to replace it.</p><p>Most older macOS installers are available directly from <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer">Apple's support website</a>, which gives you the full combo installer, rather than the smaller version available through System Preferences or the App Store. However, you may need to download the installer from the App Store for newer versions, like macOS Monterey.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/macOS-installer-downloads-from-Apple-website.jpg><h3 id=reset-the-pram-and-nvram>5. Reset the PRAM and NVRAM</h3><p>The PRAM and NVRAM store various settings and preferences on your Mac, such as your screen brightness, sound volume, and display resolution. Errors with your PRAM or NVRAM might explain why macOS couldn't be installed on your computer.</p><p>Fortunately, it's easy to reset these settings without erasing any of your personal data. To do so, restart your Mac and hold <strong>Option + Cmd + P + R</strong> while it powers on.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/PRAM-reset-key-combination.jpg><p>Keep holding all those keys until you see a second Apple logo or hear a second startup sound, at which point the reset is complete.</p><h3 id=run-first-aid-on-your-startup-disk>6. Run First Aid on Your Startup Disk</h3><p>Still seeing that the macOS installation couldn't be completed? There might be disk permission or fragmentation errors on your startup disk. It's easy to fix most of these kinds of errors using the Disk Utility app, which comes pre-installed on macOS.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong><p>Open <strong>Disk Utility</strong> from the Utilities folder in Applications. Select your Mac's startup disk in the sidebar—usually called <strong>Macintosh HD</strong>—then click <strong>First Aid</strong>. When you <strong>Run</strong> First Aid, Disk Utility scans your disk for errors and repairs whatever it can.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2020/01/First-Aid-option-in-Disk-Utility-on-macOS.jpg><p>If you can't access Disk Utility normally, boot into macOS Recovery using the instructions below and try to run First Aid again.</p><h3 id=use-macos-recovery-to-reinstall-macos>7. Use macOS Recovery to Reinstall macOS</h3><p>If macOS still won't install properly, you might need to reinstall the whole operating system instead. You can do this using macOS Recovery on your Mac.</p><p>The process for <a href=#>booting into macOS Recovery</a> is a different for Intel and Apple silicon Macs.</p><p>On an Intel Mac, restart your Mac and hold <strong>Option + Cmd + R</strong> while it powers on. Release the keys when you see an Apple logo or hear a startup sound, at which point a <strong>macOS Utilities</strong> window appears.</p><p>On an Apple silicon Mac, shut it down, then press and hold the <strong>Power</strong> button until the startup options screen appears. Click <strong>Options</strong>, then click <strong>Continue</strong>.</p><p>Once in macOS Recovery, click <strong>Reinstall macOS</strong> to install the latest version of macOS. This might take a while, since your Mac needs to download the new software first.</p><strong class=ad-zone-advertising-tag></strong> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/static1.makeuseofimages.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2019/02/macos-downgrade-reinstall-macos.jpg><h3 id=erase-your-mac-and-restore-from-a-backup>8. Erase Your Mac and Restore From a Backup</h3><p>The last troubleshooting solution for any software-related problem is to erase your startup disk and reinstall macOS from scratch. With a new version of macOS on your computer, you can then restore all your data from a Time Machine backup.</p><p>If you don't back up your Mac before you erase the startup disk, you will lose all your data: photos, music, files, and everything else.</p><p>Follow these <a href=#>instructions to erase and restore your Mac</a>.</p><h2 id=use-mac-utilities-to-avoid-future-macos-errors>Use Mac Utilities to Avoid Future macOS Errors</h2><p>As you've seen, there are several reasons an error message might say macOS could not be installed on your computer. We've shown you how to troubleshoot these problems, but you have a better chance avoiding them if you keep your Mac in tip-top shape all the time.</p><p>Lots of free apps offer to free up more storage or remove malware to help you do this.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7rq3KnqysnZ%2Bbe6S7zGirmp9fm7a5ecyamqirXZi8trjDZqWorF2Xsm61zayrmqScmrFuu81msKitomKwsLnPrqueql2av7O70Wg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
