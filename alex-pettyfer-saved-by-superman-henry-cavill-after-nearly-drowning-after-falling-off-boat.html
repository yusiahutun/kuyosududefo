So I can officially say I’ve been saved by Henry. And I’m very grateful to be on this film with [him].”</p><p>“It was an amazing honor, by the way, to be on this film with you,” Alex Pettyfer added, turning to Henry Cavill.</p><p>“Because it’s a learning curve to see how a No. 1 [on the call sheet] treats everyone in the cast and crew. I got an email two weeks before I started filming from this man saying, ‘I’m excited to collaborate with you.’”</p><p>The actors are on the bill for the Guy Ritchie flick, based on Damien Lewis’ book, Churchill’s Secret Warriors: The Explosive True Story of the Special Forces Desperadoes of WWII. The piece of fiction revolves around Operation Postmaster, an operation in World War II where Brits steal axis ships on the Spanish island of Fernando Po.</p><p>Other cast include Alan Ritchson, Eiza Gonzalez, Henry Golding and Fiennes Tiffin.</p><p>Tiffin said of the Superman actor: “Gentleman is the right word, for sure.</p><p>“And it’s because he has an unwavering commitment to the cause and energy and consistency and mood. [He has an] ability to just keep everybody up and keep the momentum going.”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-superman-to-james-bond>Superman to James Bond?</h2><p>Although talk of Tinsel Town has decided Godzilla actor Aaron Taylor-Johnson should be the next 007, Cavill’s co-stars think he should play James Bond.</p><p>34-year-old Gonzalez, said: “It’s hard not to look at Henry Cavill and think of James Bond, to be really honest.</p><p>“Obviously, I’m part of the group of people that are rooting for him to get it hopefully, if that was a possibility.”</p><p>It’s said he was up for the part back in 2006, but Daniel Craig beat him to the top spot.</p><p>Now he’s retired the role, Taylor-Johnson is rumored to be the next Bond in line. However, no official offers have been made.</p><p><strong>The Ministry of Ungentlemanly Warfare&nbsp;will hit theaters on April 19.</strong></p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFtZmlrX2eGcK3Lnq9mqJWpwbqyxKtkrJmmmrFurthmqq6olae6orqMoZynqqlisKLCyKWjZpmWqbKzec2emKukqWKxs7vWp6Cnn12Ws7Wx0WadmqScnruoec6fnWaan5bBcA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
