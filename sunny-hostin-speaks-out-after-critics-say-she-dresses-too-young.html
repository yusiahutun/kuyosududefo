She candidly reflected on <a href=#>her cosmetic surgeries</a> while debuting her new look after a breast reduction, lift and liposuction.</p><p>“I feel like a better version of myself,” she told <a href=#>People </a>in January 2023. “It was a health decision and a self-care decision.”</p><p>Sunny continued, “I thought I would feel shame, like, ‘Oh my God, I’m doing plastic surgery like all these crazy celebrities.’ But I don’t feel shame at all. And I hope sharing my story will help more people. If they’re feeling so body-conscious, the way I was — they can do what they need to do to feel better.”</p><p>The legal analyst pledged to be “really honest” about her cosmetic procedures in the future and admitted that she is now “so happy” with her new body.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46srKemqWK1sL%2FToqVmq6Carqy%2FjKisrWWRm8GmvoycqaKsmZjAbr%2FAsmSsoJVisbOx0qycrGWkpLxuxc6upaBn</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
