The following shade categories will help you understand what you want:</p><p><strong>1. Monochromatic Shades:</strong> In the color wheel, these consist of shades of the same color that come right after each other. And if you have blue eyes, then colors such as navy, cyan, brilliant blue, blue-gray, blue-black, etc. are good examples of the same. While these shades offer less contrast, they make your eye color appear more intense. Other cool-toned colors such as green or purple may give the same effect.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>2. Complementary Shades:</strong> These shades are placed right opposite each other in the color wheel. When you use an eyeliner of a complementary shade, it makes your eyes pop and look bigger than they would with any other shade. For blue eyes, complementary colors include copper, bronze, olive brown, coffee, or other warm and peachy shades.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>3. Classic Shades:</strong> If you are not in the mood to experiment, then opt for a classic black or charcoal eyeliner for a low-key makeup look.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Don’t forget Your Skin Undertone:</strong> You already know the importance of considering one’s eye color before buying an eyeliner. But, it is also important to understand that your skin’s undertone plays a significant role too, which can make you love or hate an eyeliner shade. Whether you have a warm undertone or a cool undertone, ensure that the eyeliner shade matches the same to avoid bringing focus to the imperfections on your face.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Formula:</strong> It always helps that the formula of your eyeliner consists of nourishing botanical ingredients such as shea butter, mango seed butter, meadowfoam oil, jojoba oil, avocado oil, vitamin E, non-toxic and vegan wax, etc. The formula should be creamy and glide smoothly without tugging your skin or skipping any patches.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Easy Application:</strong> It is important that the eyeliner you’re investing in is easy to apply and beginner-friendly. This could mean a creamy-textured pencil liner, retractable kohl liner, or a felt-tipped liquid liner. By investing in such products, you can reduce application errors, smudges, and raccoon eyes, while also saving time.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Lasting Power:</strong> Lastly, you must check whether your eyeliner is adequately long-lasting and requires no frequent touch-ups. To enhance its lasting power, it is best if the product is transfer-resistant, smudge-proof, water-resistant, and humidity-resistant.&nbsp;</p><p>So, there you have it! The products mentioned above are some of the best eyeliners for blue eyes. Moreover, eyeliner plays an essential role in intensifying the beauty of your eyes. The ones with warmer tones or earthy tones can also try their hands on eyeliners for blue eyes. We bet you will look super gorgeous!
