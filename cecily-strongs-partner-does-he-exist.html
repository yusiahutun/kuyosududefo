However, she has never been one to conform to societal expectations regarding relationships. Despite her age, she has always been content with being single.</p><p>Her desire to stay single is perhaps influenced by the emotional scars left by her parent’s divorce and her anxiety. Her family and friends, however, have other ideas and have tried severally to set her up with a suitable partner. It wasn’t until a Christmas party in December 2019 that they finally succeeded, much to Strong’s surprise and pleasure.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Who_Is_Cecily_Strongs_Partner></span>Who Is Cecily Strong’s Partner?<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cecily Strong isn’t married, but she does have a boyfriend. In her memoir This Will All Be Over Soon: A Memoir, written during the pandemic, she identified her partner as Jack.</p><p>Although there is limited information regarding Cecily Strong’s partner, he is known as a New Yorker.

She revealed that although she was content with her single life, she agreed to talk to Jack, a cute man with a mustache, after meeting him at a 2019 Christmas party.</p><p>He wrote his phone number on the back of an old receipt, and they stayed in touch from that day. Their bond grew stronger during the pandemic, and during a date, Jack proposed a trick to help Strong stop picking at her nails when she was nervous.</p><p>“I want you to feel like you can hold my hand instead,” Jack said. Strong writes, “I didn’t tell him, but it’s one of the nicest things anyone has ever said to me.” After the date, they spoke all night; by dawn, they were officially a couple.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Cecily_Strongs_Partner_Is_a_Gift_From_Her_Late_Cousin_Owen></span>Cecily Strong’s Partner Is a Gift From Her Late Cousin, Owen<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>After Strong met Jack, she lost her cousin Owen. As a result, she thought it would be difficult to start a new relationship while grieving, but she promised herself and Owen that she would let all the love be there, along with the sadness.</p><p>Strong considered Jack a gift from Owen and was grateful for him. When Jack contracted COVID-19, her mental health suffered. She was worried about Jack’s health and constantly needed to know if he was okay. Fortunately, Jack pulled through, and their relationship got better.</p><p>Cecily Strong’s love story with Jack is a beautiful reminder that love can bloom in the most unexpected times.

Although she knew dating a coworker was frowned upon, she proceeded with the relationship anyway. In 2015, the two appeared to have ended things when they stopped posting updates about their relationship.</p><p>Strong’s next relationship was with an unnamed Italian man she met in Seville, Spain. In an interview with <a href=#>Vanity Fair</a>, Strong talked about her new man, but she did not reveal his identity.</p><p>Additionally, Strong had another ex-boyfriend who she claimed had abused her. In her memoir, she left 11 blank pages at the end of the book to represent all the things her ex had asked her to omit after reading it.</p><p>She stated that it was vital to include those pages because her story belonged to her. She hoped her ex would read it how she intended to share it and understand there was still love there.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=A_Peek_Into_the_Successful_Life_of_Cecily_Strong></span>A Peek Into the Successful Life of Cecily Strong<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Cecily Legler Strong, born February 8, 1984, is a multi-talented American actress, comedian, author, producer, and singer.
