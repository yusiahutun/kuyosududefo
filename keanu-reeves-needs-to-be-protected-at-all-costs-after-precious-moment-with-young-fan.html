Matrix movie star Keanu Reeves was seen making a fan encounter with a young boy extra special recently. The celebrity has been regarded as one of the sincerest stars you’ll ever meet – if you’re one of the lucky ones to stumble upon a meeting.

Now, a recent touching clip of Keanu Reeves meeting a fan has come to light, showing he’s still, and always will be, a gentleman.</p><figure class="wp-block-grvmedia-grv-video GRVMultiVideo"></figure><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-keanu-reeves-sweet-moment-with-young-fan>Keanu Reeves’ sweet moment with young fan</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1410379879-1024x682.jpg><p>In a video shared on <a href=#>Twitter</a>, a mom was recording the moment they met the film actor.</p><p>We can see at the beginning, Keanu, wearing a baseball cap, black tee, pants and boots appears casual. Keanu Reeves walks up to the group of fans, and appears to nod at the request of the young boy who is holding a football. They were holding Funko Pops of the <a href=#>John Wick</a> star for an autograph.</p><p>He then gestures for the boy, whose holding a football, to follow him to the other part of the sidewalk, so they can play catch.</p><p>The fans were waiting behind a barrier in the hopes of catching a glimpse or photo of the star. The youngster was allowed to crawl underneath for the cute moment.</p><p>The 59-year-old didn’t need his Matrix-bending skills for the sport, though. His throwing arm was in strong form, and the pair went back and forth a few times in an adorable moment.</p><p>Keanu Reeves then moves back to the crowd towards another fan, so they can take a selfie with him.</p><p>Smiling, he’s happy to oblige. It also didn’t seem like he was rushed for time, and enjoyed the little encounter.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-twitter wp-block-embed-twitter"><p lang=en dir=ltr>He is such a perfect soul that he would play ball with his little fan and gift him the most precious moment of his life😇 He must be protected at all cost!! 🤩❤️</p><p>🎥Thanks for sharing Annette Morales Cruz 🙏🏻✨</p><p>“Keanu Reeves was good to us and even played football with Elijah” <a href=#>pic.twitter.com/ZC5Lku8Lwv</a></p>— keanureevesfanpage.tr (@keanureevesfptr) <a href=#>September 26, 2023</a></figure><p>View Tweet</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-i-asked-him-to-play-catch-with-me>‘I asked him to play catch with me’</h2><p>The adorable moment took place in Houston, Texas, where Keanu Reeves fans flocked to his band Dogstar perform.</p><p>It’s not uncommon for the movie star’s kind interactions with loyal fans. This one seemed extra special by the normality of the back-and-forth, though.</p><p>Annette Cruz, grandmother of the young boy called Elijah, hoped she’d bump into him in the city last month after hearing he was there.</p><p>Speaking to KHOU 11, Elijah’s older brother Caleb explained what happened.</p><p>“He like came out, and I didn’t expect his hair to be like a little white. I knew his hair was long but I didn’t expect it to be white.</p><p>“And when I got his signature and my brother got his signature, I asked him if he could play catch with me.</p><p>“I asked him the first time and he kind of mumbled something. But I didn’t hear him so I asked him again, and he said ‘yeah come on let’s go.'”</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-let-s-get-a-pint>‘Let’s get a pint’</h2><p>It comes after he made a surprise stop off at a local pub in England. He was doing a documentary outside of London in Britain in the county of Hertfordshire.</p><p>“I was outside London doing a documentary, and it was just shepherd’s pie weather. It’s kinda cool, not rainy but a little misty drizzly something. And I was like, ‘let’s get a shepherd’s pie and a pint’”.</p><p>The pub said he was a “lovely man” and made “their day” for stepping in. He even took photos with the men in the kitchen and praised them over the food.</p><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-rich is-provider-facebook wp-block-embed-facebook"></figure><p>Dogstar <a href=# rel=nofollow>announced</a> their first album in 23 years as well as a <a href=#>music</a> tour.
