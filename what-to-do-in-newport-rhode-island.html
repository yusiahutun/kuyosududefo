Cut to me googling “easy East Coast babymoons” at 2AM. Thankfully, I landed on Newport, Rhode Island, a beachside destination roughly 3.5 hours away from New York City. Fans of HBO's Gilded Age (myself included) are no stranger to the 1800’s hotspot boasting breathtaking seaside views, fresh seafood, and all-around New England charm. Typically we opt for quaint Airbnbs, however I needed a little bit of luxury (and room service) — and the historic <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hotelviking.com/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Hotel Viking" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Hotel Viking</a> in downtown Newport fit the bill.</p><img alt="the hotel viking newport rhode island" title="the hotel viking newport rhode island" fetchpriority=high width=1728 height=1152 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/hv-at-dusk-1670877125.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Ed Wonsek&amp;#xA;617-967-2766</span><p>The Hotel Viking at dusk</p><h2 data-node-id=4 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>What I Drove</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link="https://www.landroverusa.com/vehicles/defender/index.html?gclid=CjwKCAiAv9ucBhBXEiwA6N8nYIaIT34pjdz5JuVJ7Gi1z7QFUPxCmkVu3hWrqZO5HXxn8YI1fhKqhBoC6-EQAvD_BwE&gclsrc=aw.ds" data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="2022 Land Rover Defender 90 V8" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">2022 Land Rover Defender 90 V8</a>. As a carless Brooklynite, the Defender felt like a true indulgence (sidenote: I will forever side eye all future trips on the MTA.) My husband and I traded taking turns pushing around this SUV with pleasure. It was large enough to feel extra roomy—without feeling monstrous—and turned more than a few heads as we cruised around town. Small details like the center console that allowed you to chill drinks (so major), heating and cooling seats, ClearSight interior rearview mirror (no obstructed views, ever) make this model stand out from the pack. Despite my limited car knowledge, I have to talk about the pick-up — this baby (no pun intended) goes from 0 to 60 mph in less than 4.9 seconds, very impressive for a nearly 6,000 lb car. While the interior felt luxe, it was also functional. Great in case you decided to take this for an off-road spin — or have to potentially clean up spilled milk.</p><h2 data-node-id=7 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>What I Packed</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">We lucked out with the weather, experiencing high 50s and 60s all weekend, which allowed me to pack layered, spring-adjacent looks. I’m a huge proponent of traveling in a chic matching set or jumpsuit (btw, Parc has great options), so there’s no need to change upon arrival. With a growing belly that changes week by week, pieces that stretch are a necessity. For dinner, I wanted to feel a little sexy so curve-hugging dresses were my nighttime M.O. Finally, Newport is incredibly walkable which meant I needed a pair of comfortable slip-on sneakers to hold me down while I got some steps in.</p><h2 data-node-id=11 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60"><strong>The Itinerary</strong></h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=12 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Friday</strong>: We timed our arrival to Newport for roughly 2pm so we could enjoy an early check-in at Hotel Viking and take advantage of the warmest day of the weekend. We left the car with the valet to set-off by foot and explore the iconic 3.5 mile Cliff Walk alongside the Atlantic Ocean. To say the views were dramatic would be an understatement. I was blown away. Add in some hot chocolate and fresh baked cookies from Picnic Cafe and we had a lovely afternoon date.</p><img alt="what to do in newport rhode island, janell hickman" title="what to do in newport rhode island, janell hickman" width=1024 height=768 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/img-4367-2-1670875629.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Courtesy</span><p>Writer Janell Hickman-Kirby</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=14 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Up next was dinner at the oldest operating restaurant in the U.S, White Horse Tavern. The charming 1673-built, two story cottage features contemporary tavern food with a twist. I’d recommend the lump crab cocktail, traditional Caesar salad with white anchovies, crispy duck breast (add the whipped potatoes), and lobster ravioli.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=15 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Saturday</strong>: After staying up late watching the current season of Netflix’s Top Boy, we grabbed a quick bite at Hotel Viking’s in-house cafe, Hill Market. Think delicious pastries, healthy nibbles, and freshly brewed coffee from local purveyors.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Stop 1</strong>: #Influenced by one of my travel Instagram accounts (<a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.instagram.com/theplaceiwastellingyouabout/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action=@theplaceiwastellingyouabout class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">@theplaceiwastellingyouabout</a>), I wanted to check out the recently-opened Wayfinder Hotel and Nomi Park Restaurant. The 197-room property boasts a cool, laid-back vintage coastal vibe about 15-minutes from downtown Newport, a nice departure from the more classic properties in the area. I’d suggest booking a room here during the summer to enjoy an afternoon of pool-side cocktails and live music.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=17 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Stop 2</strong>: After a yummy brunch, we noticed a storm was on the way and booked it over to the legendary Marble House formerly owned by the Vanderbilt family. The two-story, 50-room French-inspired “summer cottage” was maintained by a staff of 26 and is still adorned with 22-karat panels, painted ceiling murals, millions of dollars of marble (roughly $7 million worth), and an authentic Chinese Tea House located on the back lawn overlooking the Atlantic Ocean. #Casual. Plan on spending at least an hour here to truly take in the full grandeur of this iconic home.</p><img alt="110 west 80 st 4r, ny, ny 10024212 874 3879" title="110 west 80 st 4r, ny, ny 10024212 874 3879" width=3000 height=2328 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/marble-house-gold-room-photo-by-gavin-ashworth-1670877602.jpeg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Gavin Ashworth</span><p>Marble House Gold room</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=19 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Stop 3</strong>: Next-up, a much-needed mother-to-be massage at <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.hotelviking.com/spa/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="Spa Fjor" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">Spa Fjor</a> back at our hotel. I wish I could report back with more detail, but I passed out thanks to Susan's magic touch. All my pregnancy discomfort (hello, rib pain and random Charlie horses) melted away. If you have time to spare, check out the infrared sauna, Himalayan salt wall, and indoor pool.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Stop 4</strong>: We ended the evening at Bar ‘Cino, a short walk away from our hotel. The bustling Italian restaurant helmed by Chef Mariana Gonzalez-Trasvina features a mix of delicious pastas and pizzas. It was hard to make a decision, so we ordered a mix of everything: shaved arugula salad, baked clams pomodoro, a grilled prosciutto and fig pizza, spaghetti carbonara, and olive oil cake.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=23 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60"><strong>Sunday</strong>: Before heading back to Brooklyn, we had one final meal in Newport at The Vanderbilt, an Auberge Resort. If decor is your thing, The Vanderbilt is a visual feast. I instantly fell in love with the conservatory room, a sun-drenched indoor dining area that overlooks the garden patio. The brioche French toast paired with the bowl of local fruits? *chefs kiss*</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Post-baby, I’ll be right back in Newport recreating this relaxing trip all over again.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/d911ecb0-e6c5-4397-b7c8-7eb0bc241fdb_1503951887.jpg alt="Headshot of Janell M.
