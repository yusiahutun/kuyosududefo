On Thursday, the two were each other's dates to the gala performance of Cabaret At The Kit Kat Club in London, and for the occasion, they showed off their individual styles. Kate, for her part, went the ultra-sexy route in a slinky red silk dress with a draped neckline and a single spaghetti-strapped silhouette. She matched her nails to the crimson color of her midi dress, and accessorized with a pair of strappy black heels with studded detailing, a stack of bangles on her wrist, and diamond studs.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_6-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In Evan's case, she opted for a black cardigan set with metallic patterned trousers and gold platform heels. Both ladies wore their blonde hair down in loose, middle-parted waves, and paired their dewy skin with glossy pink lips.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Kate was previously engaged to Bellamy from 2011 to 2014, and the former couple share an 11-year-old son, Bing, while Elle is now married to the musician and they welcomed their first child, a daughter, Lovella Dawn, three years ago.<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last year, Kate revealed that she got over her breakup from Bellamy by "taking accountability" for what went wrong in the relationship. During an appearance on the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Reign with Josh Smith</a> podcast, Kate admitted that she had to be "honest" with herself after her "second failed baby-daddy relationship" (Kate has an 18-year-old son Ryde with her ex-husband Chris Robinson and a daughter, Rani, 4, with her fiancé Danny Fujikawa).&nbsp;<br></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"That was when it started to shift because that's where I think you find your power," Hudson said. "When you realize how imperfect we all are, when you're OK with that, it's very liberating."</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57ypqrnmWYqrG0u81mnqKqnKh6r7XGoatmp6Wpeq6t061km52coa6uxYywoJ%2BdXai5qrrKsmSrnZRisbOx0qxkcG1kbIN6gA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
