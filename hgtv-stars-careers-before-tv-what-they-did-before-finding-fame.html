While some celebs like <a href=#><strong>Drew Scott</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Jonathan Scott</strong></a> had experience in television, other TV personalities like <a href=#><strong>Joanna Gaines</strong></a> and <a href=#><strong>Chip Gaines</strong></a> were simply regular people before finding Hollywood superstardom through their show, <a href=#>Fixer Upper</a>.</p><p>Unlike other networks, it seems the celebs of the famous home renovation channel don’t follow the conventional path to fame and fortune. In fact, the majority of stars like <strong>Nicole Curtis</strong>,<strong> Scott McGillivray</strong> and others were asked to audition after being randomly contacted by producers. Because of the format of the series, only a handful of them have backgrounds in entertainment.</p><p>There are exceptions to every rule, though, like the <a href=#>Property Brothers</a> stars Drew and Jonathan. The duo worked all over Hollywood before landing their popular TV show. While the Buying and Selling hosts enjoyed acting and modeling, they caught the eye of HGTV producers thanks to their side business of renovating and flipping houses.</p><p>As for <a href=#><strong>Christina Haack</strong></a>, the decor guru was a former real estate agent. She became one of the most familiar faces on HGTV when she landed Flip or Flop with her now ex-husband, <a href=#><strong>Tarek El Moussa</strong></a>, in 2013. While she continues to host the show with her former spouse, the blonde beauty is also the lead of her new show, Christina on the Coast.</p><p>Coming from her earlier days in real estate, Christina couldn’t feel more grateful to have paved such a successful career in home renovation TV. However, she did once open up about the stress she felt while venturing out on her own to host Christina on the Coast.</p><p>“I’m not gonna lie, yes, it is more pressure,” she shared with <a href=#>Entertainment Tonight</a>. “Especially knowing that the whole thing was followed from start to finish, and that’s the first time I’ve ever done that on television. I definitely felt pressure for it to be perfect.”</p><p>Fortunately, the real estate investor said being on <a href=#>Flip of Flop</a> taught her everything she needed to know about being a confident and endearing solo TV star. “I never went to design school, I never claimed to be a designer professionally, but I’ve learned so much [during Flip or Flop],” she once told Newsweek. “I really enjoyed filming Flip or Flop — [I] still do.”</p><p><strong>Check out the gallery below to see what your favorite HGTV stars were doing before they became famous!</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLjOrJyrr5WauK3FjZympmegpMC1v46hnq2uXajBor7SZpqaqpWav7R5wZ6dqKqVYsG3edahmK1lpJ2yunnDoptmmpWbvLOxjJ%2Bgp5yZo7RussCmnGg%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
