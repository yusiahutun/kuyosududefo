Recently, licensed esthetician Mel Lagares posted anincredibly informative thread on Twitter that sparked conversations around the relationship between smoking tobacco and skincare, including how to combat the issues that can arise, ingredients to incorporate into your skincare routine to keep your skin clear, as well as what to avoid doing — which instantly made me curious about the effects of weed."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

"If you're smoking, definitely stop," she exclaims. "Smoking affects the skin in multiple ways. It causes oxidative stress in the form of free radicals — like pollution can — it decreases the building of new collagen, it increases the destruction of existing collagen, it causes damage to elastin, one of the materials in the skin that helps it keep its shape or elasticity, and it helps to promote increased skin cancer."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Uh, yikes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Zubritsky doubles down on the harmful effects of tobacco in particular. "The ingredients in tobacco contain free radicals, which leads to oxidative stress in our body," she explains. "This can directly result in reduced blood flow and oxygen delivery to our cells as well as DNA damage. Without proper blood flow (a process called vasoconstriction), our cells cannot function properly."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-is-there-one-form-of-smoking-thats-more-harmful-than-others></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Is There One Form of Smoking That's More Harmful Than Others?</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to Dr. Sarkar, it's hard to say right now.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The M.D. explains that while the effects of what smoking cigarettes does to the skin has been studied for decades, vaping, for example, is still quite new and not enough is known just yet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_29-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"But there's definite info that shows burns — from explosion of the devices — and contact dermatitis or allergic reactions are occurring," she says. "The allergic reactions that have been seen are generally reactions to nickel."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_31-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The nickel in vapes are usually found in the heating coil. So when users are inhaling the smoke, they're also getting a whiff of the metal as well.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes marijuana, it's kind of in the same boat as vaping, seeing as there haven't been many studies on how it impacts the skin due to legalization being a recent phenomenon. However, allergic reactions, like hives, have occurred, explains the M.D.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Furthermore, smoking — whether it be weed, tobacco, or otherwise — can cause premature aging.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"The more we purse our lips together, the more likely we are to develop smoker's lines," says Dr. Zubritsky. "Those who smoke are constantly decreasing their oxygen availability, which in turn leads to aging skin."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_39-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Smoking More Weed Right Now?

"Although we do have treatments that help somewhat."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_46-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The first thing both dermatologists recommend is being extra diligent when it comes to sun protection and incorporation antioxidants like a vitamin C serum into your routine. "In addition, using moisturizers religiously can help to alleviate some of the dry skin that we see on the face, chest, neck, and hands," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The M.D. also adds that laser resurfacing treatments and chemical peels can help reveal fresh new skin and a brightened complexion.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Lastly, Dr. Zubritskysuggests making sure to have a balanced diet, and drinking enough water on a daily basis is extra important.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCuu8qipaBlp5qypXnEn52em6SoerC6jKyioqY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
