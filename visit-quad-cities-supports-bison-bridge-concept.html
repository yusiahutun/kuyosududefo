To compete for increases in visitation and identity, we feel the Bison Bridge will help us achieve numerous goals, with the leading one activating our global asset—the world-renowned Mississippi River,” the release says.</p><p>“Within our Tourism Master Plan, there are several recommendations that this idea connects with on a meaningful level. It’s our expectation that if we all desire a destination that attracts people and shapes resident pride, enhances quality of life and place for residents, and differentiates the QC we must have these discussions with our partners in the State of Illinois and the State of Iowa.”</p><h2 class=inline-related-stories__heading>Related Local 4 News stories</h2><ul class=inline-related-stories__list><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Bison Bridge project gets $4 million in support">Bison Bridge project gets $4 million in support</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Bison Bridge group urges participation in May 11 online meeting">Bison Bridge group urges participation in meeting</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Bison Bridge resolution passes Illinois House">Bison Bridge resolution passes Illinois House</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Bison Bridge team announces engineering firm to help with I-80 project">Bison Bridge team announces engineering firm to help&nbsp;…</a></h3></li><li class=inline-related-stories__story><h3 class=article-list__article-title><a href=# class=article-list__article-link data-link-type=content-link data-link-position=1 data-link-pinned=false data-link-label="Rapids City Mayor and restaurant owner believe in Bison Bridge vision">Rapids City Mayor and restaurant owner believe in&nbsp;…</a></h3></li></ul><p>“Big ideas like this and bringing them to life is not easy, and they take some political and civic will to move them forward. Most importantly, big ideas are what make communities stand out from the competition, and make no secret, we are in a battle for visitors, talent, and investment,” he continued.</p><p>“We feel it would be a missed opportunity not to explore this concept fully and transparently, and we will continue to advocate for meaningful dialogue about it. This is about the Quad Cities of the future, our story, and the legacy that we all want to create for generations.”</p><p>A<strong>bout Visit Quad Cities</strong></p><p>Founded in 1990, Visit Quad Cities (formerly, the Quad Cities Convention & Visitors Bureau), was formed when the Davenport and Bettendorf Visitor Bureaus and Illinois Quad Cities Convention & Visitors Bureau merged to become simply, Quad Cities Convention & Visitors Bureau.
