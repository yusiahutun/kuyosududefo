There is also the inappropriateness of the raw material: happy symbols would bring so much more joy if they were biodegradable.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Mind you, quite a few people have told me they are excited about the yellow ambassadors of joy and positivity. They don’t cost us anything (except when we buy the merchandise, of course) and Hong Kong needs cheering up, they say.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And an art therapist friend says she often uses rubber ducks when working with children because they are devoid of meaning and seen as perfectly unthreatening, which helps her young clients open up.</p><img data-qa=BaseImage-handleRenderImage-StyledImage src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/styles/wide_landscape/public/d8/video/thumbnail/2023/05/25/CLIP-thumb.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewDuration class="css-dkee4u eaw92su1">01:23</p><p data-qa=SCMPYoutubeVideoPreview-PreviewTitle class="css-1ajvbe4 eaw92su2">Giant rubber duck makes its comeback in Hong Kong after a decade, bringing a new friend</p><p>Giant rubber duck makes its comeback in Hong Kong after a decade, bringing a new friend</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">But are the ducks really so passive? I would like to propose alternative readings, and perhaps that will make them (slightly) more palatable to fellow curmudgeons.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">After all, “Double Ducks” doesn’t sound that different from “double Dutch”, a British expression for gibberish. Perhaps it is a mischievous message from the Dutch artist to look beyond the surface.</p>Hofman’s giant rubber ducks have been taken to the most unlikely of places, presumably on the assumption that they are truly universal – you may remember reading about the one <a class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">washed away</span></a> in a flood in China’s Guizhou province in 2014.<p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Perhaps the artist is making a point about American cultural hegemony. After all, it only became an icon of childhood nostalgia in this part of the world because of Ernie, the Jim Henson Muppet who always bathed with his rubber duckie on that widely exported children’s television programme Sesame Street.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Think also of how often it has been used as a protest symbol: it was adopted by anti-government protesters in Brazil in 2016 and by the pro-democracy rallies in Bangkok in 2020.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">And guess what? The artist has suggested that he wants his ducks to redefine public space, and to attract encounters and conversation. People gathering! If that’s not a radical rallying cry in Hong Kong, I don’t know what is.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">So it seems the ducks are not just jolly toys lulling us into collective amnesia.
