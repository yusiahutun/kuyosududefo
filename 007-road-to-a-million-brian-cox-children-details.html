Find out here…&nbsp;</p><h3>Does Brian Cox have children?&nbsp;</h3><p id=eC_7OI7g9Yf data-wc=79>Like his character in Succession, Brian has four children. The actor has been married three times, and shares two children, daughter Margaret and son Alan, with his second wife, Caroline Burt. His son Alan, 53, followed in his dad’s footsteps as an actor, and has starred in New Amsterdam and Young Sherlock Holmes as John Watson. Brian also opened up about Margaret, and her difficulties with an eating disorder, in his 2021 memoir</p><figure class=videoPlayerClass_v1tejlff>WATCH: Phillip Schofield nearly cries as Brian Cox praises him for coming out</figure><p id=eaCKY4-hz3s data-wc=71>Speaking in an interview with National Post at the time of its release, he explained: "It was a very, very tough time, a really brutal time for her, because she nearly died… I’ll never forget coming to see her, I was walking towards her house, and there was this woman who was outside doing exercises and I thought, 'Who is this lady?' And it was my daughter... It was just horrific."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/6aebfd1139a1-gettyimages-1384689079.jpg><p id=eouQ5sEB0w- data-wc=87>During the interview, Brian also opened up about being a dad to 21-year-old Orson and 19-year-old Torin, who he shares with his current wife, Nicole Ansari. He said: "I’m hopeless... I mean, I profess love to them. I do that. But they have their issues, and this is where my lack of parenting comes in, because I just panic," adding that he could be tough on himself. Orson and Torin have remained out of the public spotlight, so not much is known about Brian’s two youngest sons.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/120e222175d1-gettyimages-1474988012.jpg><h2>What is 007: Road to a Million all about?&nbsp;</h2><p id=eJn5aN8L_rmU data-wc=57>The new show sees contestants competing in teams of two on a global adventure to win the ultimate prize of up to £1million - with a James Bond twist. The synopsis reads: "Filmed in many iconic Bond locations—from the Scottish Highlands to Venice and Jamaica—this cinematic format will be a true test of intelligence, endurance, and heroism."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Succession star Brian Cox to host James Bond game show - and it sounds seriously good" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/785392c9a24c-successionbriancox.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Succession star Brian Cox to host James Bond game show - and it sounds seriously good" class="miniCardLink_m75k0hi hm-link" href=# rel>Succession star Brian Cox to host James Bond game show - and it sounds seriously good</a></h5></li></ul><p id=eVGpYp2YRVVK data-wc=55>And what about Brian’s character? It continues: "The Controller is villainous and cultured, and revels in the increasingly difficult journeys and questions the contestants must overcome. He has millions of pounds to give away—up to £1m per couple—but he doesn’t make it easy. Whilst he lurks in the shadows, he is watching and controlling everything."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/5fa9e590c14d-brian-cox-new-show.jpg> <a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow">WATCH AMAZON PRIME VIDEO HERE</a><p id=eBq-GvhxO92j data-wc=61>Speaking about the show, Brian said: "I got to see how ordinary people would cope with being on a James Bond adventure. As they travel the world to some of the most iconic Bond locations, it gets more intense and nail-biting. I enjoyed my role as both villain and tormentor, with a license to put the hopeful participants through the mangle."&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfm7atuY5uZ3BpY2l8cXyWZqmomZRiwbB5wGakoqScnryvecGroJqmXZi8uXnCoaClnKKau26wxK2YoqSjZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
