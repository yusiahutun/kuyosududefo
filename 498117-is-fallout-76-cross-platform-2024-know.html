The video game was initially released in 2018 but received mixed reviews from gamers and critics. However, despite this, the RPG title was popular among players, mainly because it was the first online multiplayer in the franchise. Since its inception and subsequent improvements via updates, fans have been wondering if you can play with friends on other platforms.

It is an instalment in the <i>Fallout</i> <a href=#>series</a> and a prequel to previous entries. In the gameplay, players explore the open world, which has been torn apart by nuclear war, with others. The gameplay is excellent, and you can join forces with other real-world players or friends to explore and compete. But despite all its shortcomings and improvements, does <i>Fallout 76</i> support cross-platform?</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/2c6171a77fd35734.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Four Xbox exclusives heading to rivals in big shift</span></p></a><h2 id=498117-is-fallout-76-cross-platform class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Is Fallout 76 cross platform?</h2><p class=align-left>Unfortunately, the <a href=#>video game</a> doesn't support cross platform compatibility. The lack of the attribute means that Xbox and PC players cannot play the RPG title together online. But why does such a vast title lack a feature that other competitor series have?</p><h3 id=498117-gaming-issues class=table-of-contents__scroll-section>Gaming issues</h3><p class=align-left>One reason is that <i>Fallout 76</i> has <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">had issues</a> since its release in 2018. The title was criticised for numerous technical problems, overall design, lack of gameplay purpose, and the initial absence of human non-playable characters.
