Still so missed.</p><p>Here’s what I wrote on that day.<br>As the sun sets on this planet tonight, for the first time in 94 years it is without my hero, Little Jimmy Dickens.<br>Why was he my hero? Jimmy made more out of his time on earth than anyone I've ever known; an incredible life in every measurable way. Longevity? Yes, practically unheard of. Faith? Totally and wholeheartedly. Humor? There was no one funnier, or with a better sense of it. A true entertainer? The best I've ever seen. Charm? Unmatched. Love? This was a big one. I think he loved everyone he ever met, and if not, he never let it be known. More importantly, I think everyone who ever met him loved him instantly...and forever. Romance? He and Mona had the most romantic story I've ever heard. Check it out sometime. Friendship? Well I can honestly say he was the best friend any human being could ask for. Bar none.</p><p>Much will be said and written about his incredible and unique place in Country Music history. Which could fill a book. But that isn't how I'll remember him. I will remember the human being that best check-marked all the boxes of a complete and wonderful life. My hero.</p><p>Do not mourn Little Jim. Celebrate him. Relive and share the memories. Aspire to be like him. And above all, laugh at the punchlines, the craziness, and the way he so gracefully made this planet a funnier, better, richer place while he was alive. And in doing so, will continue to for years to come.</p><p>Paisley also shared a photo of himself and Dickens playing together to accompany his text.</p><p>Paisley often included Dickens in his humorous hijinks, inviting him to appear in several of his videos, as well as in a number of skits during Paisley's long stint hosting the <a href=#>CMA Awards</a> with <a href=#>Carrie Underwood</a>, in which he would often gently poke fun at his friend's diminutive 4'11" stature.</p><a class="next-post cto" href=#>Next: The Funniest Little Jimmy Dickens Cameos</a><p><strong>See Little Jimmy Dickens Through the Years</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmm6qRmXqxrciso56xXam%2Fqq7UrZxmpJmpwa2xjKOgpqWpYrGqr8qepaxlZWLGpq3RZpinppmrsrO%2FwKuwZpyVlsGpew%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
