As <a href=#>Sophie Turner</a> is from the UK, it was reported that she wanted the kids to live with her over there, although Joe wanted them to stay with him in the US.

Documents obtained by the publication state “an amicable resolution on all issues between them is forthcoming.”</p><p>As for the temporary agreement, TMZ reports that daughters, Willa and Delphine will be with their mother from October 9 through October 21, where she’ll be allowed to travel with them to the UK.</p><p>Whilst staying in New York recently, it was reported that bestie <a href=#>Taylor Swift</a> swooped in to lend a helping hand. Reports say Taylor had <a href=#>loaned her New York City apartment</a> to the Game of Thrones star and her daughters.</p><p>It was also revealed the two had found their <a href=#>‘forever home’ in the UK</a>, and were planning on settling down there before the marriage broke down.</p><p>The documents then claim that Turner must return to the US with the two little ones on Oct 21, where <a href=#>Joe Jonas</a> will take over parenting duties until November 2, until they are back with their mother again for 20 days.</p><p>It looks like Joe will have to spend Christmas without his daughters, as they will be with their 27-year-old mother for Christmas and New Year. The documents say she will have them again from December 16 until January 7.</p><p>However, he will see them for Thanksgiving, on November 23.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=h-joe-jonas-embarks-on-jonas-brothers-tour>Joe Jonas embarks on Jonas Brothers Tour</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn1.celebritytidbit.com/uploads/39/2023/10/GettyImages-1669134152-1024x728.jpg><p>In the midst of the divorce, Joe has been on his mammoth <a href=#>music</a> tour, alongside Nick and Kevin. Although the couple have kept tight-lipped about their private life in the public eye, the middle Jo Bro did seemingly <a href=#>reference his divorce on stage</a>, not too long after the announcement.</p><p>It’s said that the 34-year-old is able to travel anywhere in the States with his two daughters when he’s taking care of them, meaning they’ll most likely be joining him on tour.</p><p>During the time he’ll be looking after his daughters, himself, Kevin and Nick will be visiting Austin, Texas; San Diego, California, and Anaheim, California.</p><p>The brothers are also set to embark on their UK tour next Summer, however, as a final settlement is reportedly close, it is thought one will be in place by then.</p><p>Related Topics</p><p>MORE CELEBRITY STORIES</p><span></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmroaSuwaqwwaKrZ5ufonxzfJFsZmpoX2Z9cLbOnmSjp56WwG6tzZ1krKegnbamedOuqaedoqh6pMHSraadsV2qvaWt055krKiVobm0eceemKuskqeyoreMn6arZZ%2Bjsm67xWaroZ2dZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
