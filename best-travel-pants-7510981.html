That’s why we tried 40 of the most popular options available. Over the course of two weeks, these bottoms became frequent flyers — we wore them on planes, trains, and automobiles and evaluated their fit, comfort, quality, durability, design, and value each step of the way. We certainly liked some more than others, which is why we narrowed our list down to the first-class pairs that felt the most comfortable while in transit and offered styling flexibility once we reached our destination.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-lululemon-wunder-train-high-rise-tight-with-pockets></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>lululemon Wunder Train High-rise Tight with Pockets</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Tight with Pockets" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/VypzntORkZ4K657UWYViwWwgLmQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lululemon-wunder-train-high-rise-tight-with-pockets-e4fb737b5a5845228ea2b4e566a16816.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Lululemon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Opacity</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Performance</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Value</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The two deep side pockets hold a surprising amount of travel necessities without becoming bulky or getting weighed down.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The pants aren’t insulated, so we were a little cold during flights.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we need a pair of pants that will move with us through every part of our journey — from the plane to our destination to all the expeditions in between — we lean on these Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Tights. We immediately put <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>the leggings</a> to the test on multiple four-hour flights, where we were able to hustle hands-free through the airport, thanks to the stretchy deep side pockets that securely held our Airpods, phone, ticket, and ID with room to spare. Even with so many items attached to our legs, it didn’t feel heavy or stiff — actually, we barely felt the items in there — and the high-waisted pants, which feature a hidden drawcord, remained secure along our midriff, never drooping as we made our way to the gate. We appreciated the extra support offered by the high-rise, too, because like many folks, we tend to bloat on extended trips, but they never cut into our stomachs or felt uncomfortable in any way. And with the choice of two different inseams — 23- and 25-inch — they fit throughout our entire body.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The soft, sweat-wicking material, which comes in over 10 colorways, also made these pants feel more luxe than other <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>run-of-the-mill leggings</a>. Not only did they never pill, but they also maintained their shape and color through multiple washes. We’ve been able to use them in everyday life, not just traveling, like a sweaty workout. But given the breathable qualities, the bottoms left us a bit cold in the air. We easily looked past this, though, because the leggings simultaneously regulated our temperature once we stepped off the plane into the tropics and we never overheated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0–20<strong>&nbsp;| Material: </strong>Nylon, lycra elastane<strong> | Colors: </strong>11<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>3</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=657 data-sizes=750px alt="A women's legs wearing Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Tight with Pockets 25-Inch" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/_Z6-jJZmKOyocjeyeUe9Y7bDo7Q=/fit-in/1500x657/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-travel-pants-test-lululemon-wunder-train-high-rise-tight-pockets-25in-taylor-mcintyre-01-368bd30dc731449ca3c0d9b8b335ccb7.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Taylor Mcintyre</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=648 data-sizes=750px alt="A woman wearing Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Tight with Pockets 25-Inch" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/hW6Q__HT2Mbk2GTidi4zM8MyztY=/fit-in/1500x648/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-travel-pants-test-lululemon-wunder-train-high-rise-tight-pockets-25in-taylor-mcintyre-02-1fa3036b755e45f2bf956faf023306c6.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Taylor Mcintyre</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-libin-womens-cargo-joggers></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Libin Cargo Joggers</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Amazon Libin Women's Cargo Joggers" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Hmf2ykJh2LsBa4UPJYx7kDgF0oI=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Libin-Womens-Cargo-Joggers-4911e9af2dea4c53879a480684b75888.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With five functional and secure pockets, we can store all our necessities and ditch an extra bag completely.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Although stretchy, these pants run slightly small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most of the travel pants on our list are around $100, but these affordable bottoms include many of the same well-thought-out details for less than half the standard price — a true steal in our eyes. The soft and stretchy polyester-spandex blend felt comfortable throughout a six-hour drive and allowed us to take long walks and hikes without feeling restrained. Admittedly, we thought we ordered one size too small at first, but the more we wore them, the more they conformed to our bodies. Still, if you prefer a bit more breathing room, we suggest sizing up.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a toddler in tow, the fabric’s flexibility and breathability were invaluable (we don’t have to tell you that running after children while traveling is extremely tiring), but we were most thankful for the five functional pockets that allowed us to travel nearly hands-free. With three zipper-closure compartments (two on the sides and one on the back) and two hook-and-loop-closure cargo pockets, we could store all our personal necessities — wallet, keys, and phone, as well as a tantrum-soothing binky — at arms reach without the need for an extra bag. At such a low cost, we couldn’t help but purchase the casual pants in multiple colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–3XL<strong>&nbsp;| Material: </strong>Polyester, spandex<strong>&nbsp;| Colors: </strong>14<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-splurge-frank--eileen-murphy-billion-dollar-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Splurge</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frank & Eileen Murphy Billion Dollar Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frank &amp;amp; Eileen Murphy Billion Dollar Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3in6L-pB1EdU5zXzZkP3y-zLUY4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/frank-eileen-murphy-billion-dollar-pant-661ce447d6494e79b822d530c5438406.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Frank & Eileen</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These pants feel like luxurious athletic bottoms, but look like deluxe work slacks.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>While the pockets add a sophisticated flair, they’re not very functional.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a name like the Billion Dollar Pant, we had high expectations for how these travel pants would perform, and we were blown away from the moment they landed on our doorstep. So much thought was put into the unboxing experience: The pants arrived with tea samples and a typewritten note that shared the history of Frank & Eileen and highlighted the brand’s generous 30-day return policy — though, we had no intention of returning them.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Flashy arrival aside, slipping these on made us feel expensive. While they look like a typical pair of rigid cropped work slacks, they felt more like custom-made high-quality leggings that still gave us the freedom to move without restrictions. We even wore them for some nighttime yoga and were impressed with how well they moved with our bodies. The pants have a functional button, yet no traditional zipper fly. But honestly, you could never tell as an onlooker or wearer, and we actually ended up appreciating that feature because when it came time to actually travel in these, the stretchy waistband prevented any uncomfortable digging. By the time our flight landed, we didn’t feel the need to freshen up or change as we normally do because the pants looked just as crisp as when we took off.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The pockets did lack functionality, though. Because much like the fake zipper fly, the back pockets were merely for decoration, and the ones on the side were so shallow we couldn’t even store our phone. Despite this minor shortcoming, the pants made traveling much more pleasant — and they gave us first-class confidence, even when flying in coach.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong>&nbsp;| Material: </strong>Cotton, spandex<strong>&nbsp;| Colors: </strong>3<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-plus-size-wayre-jetsetter-trouser></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Plus-Size</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wayre Jetsetter Trouser</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wayre Jetsetter Trouser" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/fejsMhgdzAV49Jjhi5bTC7oIvN0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Wayre-Jetsetter-Trouser-b995f13ffba84a7ca1df10509fdd82d9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wayre</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These sustainable pants are crafted from recycled bottles.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>When not in use, the hidden pocket bulges out a bit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-21 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Out of all the travel pants we tested, the Jetsetter Trouser from Wayre has the most expansive size range — going up to a size 24 — and is also offered in a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">tall version</a>. But beyond commending these pants for inclusivity, we want to discuss the pockets (there are six!), which in our opinion, far outperform any of the products on this list. Along with the standard front and back pockets, a mini pouch lays on the front of the pants, while a hidden pick-pocket-proof compartment with a zipper sits on the side to store your passport.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With so many storage capabilities, we worried these pants would quickly feel weighed down. To our surprise, though, these stayed snugly in place thanks to the buttonable waistband that featured a sneaky elasticized back. Even though the elastic didn’t fully reach to the front, the band still had plenty of give and easily expanded when we sat down — which Eves says is a make-or-break attribute for plus-sized women. “Our bodies expand as we sit down, so you want to make sure that when you take a seat, the waistband rests at a comfortable spot and your hips and thighs aren’t tightly restricted,” she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Luckily, the legs of the pants are also stretchy: Made of the brand’s Air-flex technology (a material fabricated from plastic bottles), the flexible material bent with our body. Along with the stretch, the fabric is completely spill- and odor-proof, as well as wrinkle- and UV-resistant. Combined with the athleisure-like quality and work-appropriate cropped length, the travel-friendly details quickly earned these bottoms a spot on our list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>00–24<strong> | Material: </strong>Aire-flex (recycled plastic bottles)<strong> | Colors: </strong>6<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-petite-abercrombie--fitch-ypb-studiosoft-78-length-leggings></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Petite</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Abercrombie & Fitch YPB StudioSoft Legging</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Abercrombie &amp;amp; Fitch YPB StudioSoft 7/8 Length Leggings" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CzE89Jri0DsPs3v-tL51-PHnCZg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Abercrombie-Fitch-YPB-StudioSoft-7-8-Length-Leggings-ce770b82c366431190846fe40f502964.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Abercrombie & Fitch</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Abercrombie gives us the option to select a length, something that isn’t very common for leggings.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Sweat shows through on the lighter colors.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Over the years, we’ve struggled to find leggings that fit our petite frame without bunching at our ankles. This pair from Abercrombie came to our rescue: Hitting right at our ankles, the leggings never looked too long. And while many affordable leggings stretch out with wear, these continuously provide the perfect amount of compression, almost like a second layer of skin, which allows us to feel secure without being constricted. Unlike many of the pants on this list, there is only one pocket that’s well hidden within the waistband and rather small (we could only store our ID and a credit card). Anyone who typically carries a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>crossbody</a> while traveling, though, shouldn’t be too bothered by the lack of storage because the fit far makes up for it.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To determine how truly functional these leggings are, we took our test to an additional level by wearing these pants during a high-intensity workout, rather than just en route to a vacation. They stayed in place through every move. But we did notice during our workout that sweat stains popped up around our backside on the lilac color we wore. For those who are prone to sweating, we recommend choosing one of the darker hues, like onyx to be safe. However, unless you plan on wearing these during a tropical hike, we don’t imagine this to be a huge issue.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XXL<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane<strong> | Colors: </strong>4<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>1</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-11 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=1979 data-sizes=750px alt="Close-up of a woman's legs wearing Abercrombie & Fitch YPB StudioSoft Legging" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/gmdsTmjVnOKkU487WD7YwQW6cpc=/fit-in/1500x1979/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-travel-pants-test-abercrombie-ypb-studiosoft-leggings-sophia-devito-01-facacd7d40534c3da67e4e8037ecf2fa.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Sophia DeVito</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=1944 data-sizes=750px alt="Close-up of a woman's legs wearing Abercrombie & Fitch YPB StudioSoft Legging" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/CKorXB7-s9NOCxuw6fA5qj7W8Kg=/fit-in/1500x1944/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-travel-pants-test-abercrombie-ypb-studiosoft-leggings-sophia-devito-02-2b9dd22276064e2687c53713a7cb8843.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Sophia DeVito</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-tall-outdoor-voices-relay-wide-leg-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Tall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Outdoor Voices Relay Wide Leg Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Public Lands Outdoor Voices Relay Wide Leg Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5hymhUCnVf1JaOAjG797qenSShg=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/Outdoor-Voices-Relay-Wide-Leg-Pant-8a39ec73757c47b481c82d9048a73d6c.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Public Lands</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These feel just like a cushy pair of sweatpants but look more refined.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>Though the pockets are large, putting too much in them can weigh the pants down.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Any tall woman knows the struggle of picking out a pair of pants only to find they land well above the ankle without actually being labeled as cropped. So, you’ll be happy to know that with its 32-inch inseam, these wide-leg pants from Outdoor Voices (which are the pants version of the brand’s best-selling <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Relay Short</a>) completely covered our long legs with even a little extra fabric to spare and kept us cozy throughout our trip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’d consider these pants to be two steps above your typical sweatpants — the recycled polyester material was much more flowy and lightweight than our favorite cotton sweats, making them much more suitable for outdoor activities, like hiking, in warmer temperatures. Plus, they’re so much more stylish because we’d easily wear these for errand runs or chill days in the park.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-37 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The two deep side pockets held our phone and keys throughout every part of our journey on a subway, bus, car, and airplane (seriously, we did a lot of travel in these).

The secure elastic waistband prevented any drooping, but it felt slightly uncomfortable.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Polyester, spandex<strong> | Colors: </strong>3<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><ul class="loc carousel-items mntl-carousel__items"><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-13 class="comp is-active mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=0><img width=1500 height=2384 data-sizes=750px alt="Back profile of a woman wearing Outdoor Voices Relay Wide Leg Pant carrying a suitcase." data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/KpVdma12s8nyeZYA8_BIzJEe4K0=/fit-in/1500x2384/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-travel-pants-test-outdoor-voices-relay-wide-leg-phoebe-sklansky-01-9eec36151f5d46fdbc9189a3c39ae3d0.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Phoebe Sklansky</p></span></li><li id=mntl-carousel__item_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-carousel__item mntl-block" data-ordinal=1><img width=1500 height=2597 data-sizes=750px alt="The Outdoor Voices Relay Wide Leg Pant displayed on a floor" data-expand=300 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/4df2tonJptMbVal6gMBF6u6x730=/fit-in/1500x2597/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/ins-womens-travel-pants-test-outdoor-voices-relay-wide-leg-phoebe-sklansky-03-31e615eaac0245a9a766fa6ecc89fb1c.jpeg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Phoebe Sklansky</p></span></li></ul><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-work-trips-everlane-the-dream-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Work Trips</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Dream Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/3D5pRa1a4tJwTlE1BqBrXfsaZws=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-dream-pant-969d78befccc4bc4ba14a7632c967bd9.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These sophisticated trousers are wrinkle-resistant and just as cozy as our favorite pair of leggings.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The pants are cropped, which won’t suit everyone’s style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">When we need to be prepared to walk directly into a meeting after a lengthy train ride or flight, you need a pair of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>work pants</a> that you can rely on. We’ve considered replacing every pair of work-appropriate bottoms in our wardrobe with Everlane's The Dream Pant because, while maintaining a professional flair suitable for a boardroom meeting, these wrinkle-resistant trousers still feel more comfortable than our most-broken-in pair of jeans yet look more sophisticated than our usual travel leggings.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Rather than having a zipper and snap closure like ordinary slacks, these feature hidden adjustable drawstrings to customize how tight or loose they fit. As for the mainly cotton fabric, it felt soft, smooth, and breathable, striking that hard-to-achieve middle ground of weightiness because it felt thick enough to wear during cooler months (or in chilly airports) without overheating us in the summer. We consider them to be just as comfortable (and versatile) as our favorite Lululemon leggings, albeit not as stretchy and with less pocket space, since we couldn’t squeeze our iPhone into the side pockets as we could on the Lululemon’s.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Aside from the functional design, we loved that these pants remained wrinkle-free after over 12 hours of travel and full days at the office. The cropped leg grew on us, too. We were worried they might look like capris on longer legs, but they stopped just short of the ankle and actually accentuated our height in a positive way. The crisp tapered look became another one of our favorite aspects of these pants, though we do hope Everlane will offer a full-length option in the future for those who aren’t fans of cropped styles.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-45 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re still not convinced about how amazing these pants are, two of our close friends purchased the Dream Pant after seeing us wear them — without even knowing the noteworthy details.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–4XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Cotton, modal, elastane<strong> | Colors: </strong>6<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-everlane-the-easy-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lightweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Everlane The Easy Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Everlane The Easy Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-hR2ayf1-n3n69gRlpUTV4gVLVY=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/everlane-the-easy-pant-eada5c6e920c483ca035a5230bd25dfe.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Everlane</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Along with being cozy enough for the plane ride, they were so stylish we were able to wear them multiple times throughout our vacation.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>We weren’t able to tote items around in the pockets without the waistband sagging.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-49 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re zipping around the airport with heavy luggage, the last thing you want to be wearing is a pair of pants that will weigh you down. Thankfully, these featherweight cotton bottoms flexed with our bodies, and thanks to the elastic waistband, they kept us comfortable while we waited through a four-hour flight delay.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In the past, we always preferred comfort to style while traveling. But these slip-on pants gave us the best of both worlds. Once at our destination, we were able to don the pants for multiple vacation looks, from dinner at the hotel to an exploration of the local communities. The bottoms’ adaptability made our trip more enjoyable since we were able to create trendy, functional outfits while saving space in our carry-on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Compared to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Everlane Dream Pant</a>, these are much more casual, due to its waistband and flowier fit. But both pants could use a pocket redesign. Although The Easy Pant’s pockets were quite large, heavier items (namely, our cell phone) dragged the waistband down. If you plan on purchasing these pants, we suggest storing important items in a purse or handy belt bag to prevent sagging.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XXS–XL<strong>&nbsp;| Material: </strong>Cotton, elastane<strong> | Colors: </strong>5<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-dressy-spanx-the-perfect-pant-slim-straight></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Dressy</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Spanx The Perfect Pant, Slim Straight</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="The Perfect Pant, Slim Straight" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/T4aYuW9Jm3yrE7tXLZrTrj8_Dnc=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/spanx-the-perfect-pant-slim-straight-f7ab429db97e4588937bc0bdf666b39d.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Spanx&nbsp;</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>While these pants have a structured look and beautifully sculpt your bottom, they are just as soft as a pair of leggings.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>If you have a curvier figure, these gap at the waist.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-55 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We can always count on Spanx to deliver dressy, body-contouring pants that feel like leggings — and though the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>faux-leather bottoms</a> often steal the show, we think the Perfect Pant, which we’ve called one of the best work pants before, deserves just as much (if not more) attention. The weighty ponte fabric felt much more luxe than other items we’ve purchased from the brand and looked extremely elegant without skimping on comfort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">In typical Spanx fashion, every time we slid them on we felt secure but not restricted — the pants lifted and sculpted our backside and never once sagged. The thicker waistband didn’t dig into our stomach, even after hours of sitting, and because the pant legs themselves were wider, we were able to move freely. We washed them multiple times throughout our two-week test, too, and they maintained their shape.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for the faux pockets, they enhanced the dressy factor, but the lack of functionality was rather annoying on our travel days. Ultimately, we looked past the design flaw because of how versatile the pants are; beyond traveling, we wore them multiple times to dinners, the office, and for other special occasions. And the pants almost have a customizable feel to them because they are offered in multiple lengths (including petite — no hemming necessary!). We had difficulty selecting a size, though. We have an hourglass figure, so our measurements fit into two different sizes. We opted to size up to fit our thighs, which led to some gaping along our waistline. With this body type, finding the perfect fit might not be attainable, but overall, we recommend them for their polished look, high comfort, and utility.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–3X<strong> | Material: </strong>Rayon, nylon, elastane, polyester<strong> | Colors: </strong>3<strong> | Pockets: </strong>None</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner readability=27><p>InStyle / Morgan Ashley Parker</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-jeans-liverpool-the-gia-glider-ankle-skinny-jean></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Jeans</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Liverpool The Gia Glider Ankle Skinny Jean</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Liverpool THE GIA GLIDER&amp;Acirc;&amp;reg; SKINNY PULL-ON HIGH-PERFORMANCE DENIM" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/yKzsZgA3XOMHVEGuQ9ldnz9CozU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/the-gia-glider-skinny-pull-on-high-performance-denim-cb6f6c272752496ca271be95c502b80a.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Liverpool</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Complete with a faux zipper and functioning pockets, no one will be able to tell these are jeggings.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They stretched a lot after frequent wear.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-63 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The thought of wearing jeans on a long flight sent shivers down our spine for years — why would anyone put themselves through that misery?

These stretchy jeggings have become our staple travel pants for when we want to look put together without trying hard or forgoing comfort.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a faux zipper and functioning button, the pull-on bottoms look like a high-end pair of jeans but operate exactly like leggings. Typically, we’ll wash our jeans after every two wears, but because these have similar stretch to leggings, we found that we needed to wash them after every wear for the waist to stay secure. A quick cycle in the dryer was enough to shrink them back to size, and we think a smaller size would remedy this issue completely.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-65 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Just like many <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>women’s jeans</a>, the pants are available in regular and tall lengths. The tall was perfect for our five-foot-nine frame, and hit directly at our ankles (no flood-water pants here!) They also feature four pockets. The front two were a bit too small to store anything substantial, but we could easily slip our phone and wallet into the larger pockets on the back. Truthfully, if these were available in a few more wash options and silhouettes, we’d probably replace our entire jean collection because the comfort level and price (less than $100) is hard to beat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-66 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0–16<strong> | Material: </strong>Cotton, rayon, modal, t400, lycra<strong> | Colors: </strong>2<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-lululemon-stretch-high-rise-jogger-full-length></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Lululemon High-rise Jogger</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Lululemon Stretch High-rise Jogger Full Length" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/TvrASetjtzSV_Wb09_aDG1hnkqE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/lululemon-stretch-high-rise-jogger-full-length-323bcf7f97fd4367a6b6b790ccee00cd.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>lululemon</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These pants get softer with each wash and the color doesn’t fade.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>If you’re on the shorter side they bunch at the ankles — it doesn’t alter the pants’ function, but definitely affects the style-factor.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-70 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">It may be a no-brainer to say this, but all travel pants should be comfortable. We’d consider any of the pants on our list to be cozy — that’s why we mentioned them, after all — but these joggers from Lululemon broke our comfort scale. Roomier than leggings yet softer than the average pair of sweatpants, we lived in these bottoms for the entirety of our two-week trial. In fact, we wore these so much that we had to clean them three times in two weeks, but they didn’t shrink, pill, or fade; they remained good as new, with a bonus that the drawstring never fell out during any of the washes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-71 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Wearing them on our six-hour flight from San Francisco to Hawaii, we had never ever felt so comfortable while on a plane. The mix of nylon and lycra elastane allowed the pants to stretch perfectly around our waist without any sliding or rubbing against our skin the entire time we were in the air. The pockets were also deep enough for our phone, and although there was no closure, it didn’t slip out — even while seated.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The joggers bunched more than we typically prefer for our pants, but we suppose our shorter stature had something to do with it. (And they might land at the ankle for anyone on the taller side.) But in the end, we appreciated the laid-back style that looked more versatile than most joggers.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-73 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>0–20<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, lycra elastane<strong> | Colors: </strong>8<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-74 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Elena Garcia</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-long-flights-cozy-earth-womens-modern-modal-wide-leg-pant></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Long Flights</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Cozy Earth Women's Modern Modal Wide Leg Pant</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Cozy Earth Women's Modern Modal Wide Leg Pant" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/BGH2ycAVSv6DdI-OwUDaOEi9-Yk=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/womens-modern-modal-wide-leg-pant-4902002b98874e20ad9dc22e392ae13e.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Cozy Earth&nbsp;</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These pants are like a hybrid between pajamas and our favorite blanket.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>If you’re shorter than five-foot-five they’ll need to be hemmed.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-77 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We’ve crossed many faraway destinations off our bucket lists, but long-haul flights never seem to get easier. Simply put, sitting on a cramped plane for eight-plus hours is easily the worst part of the vacation. Thankfully, these pants from Cozy Earth made our latest journey much more pleasant. Seriously — we don’t own any other everyday pants that compare to the comfort level of these. As borderline pajama pants, these bottoms felt irresistibly soft and stretchy, thanks to the blend of modal and polyester that gave them a lightweight and breathable quality. The extremely long legs also enhanced the blanket-like effect and kept us cozy in chilly airplane cabins.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-78 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because of the length, these wide-legged pants dragged a bit along the ground. This wasn’t a big issue when we were lounging at home, but we found that they became dirty very quickly — especially in the lighter shades — as we traipsed around the airport and outside. We’re five-foot-five, which we think is the height cutoff: Anyone shorter should consider getting these hemmed, otherwise you may trip, and the bottom will get soiled pretty quickly.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-79 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–3XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Modal, polyester, spandex<strong> | Colors: </strong>5<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-joggers-outdoor-voices-rectrek-jogger></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Joggers</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Outdoor Voices RecTrek Jogger</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Outdoor Voices RecTrek Jogger" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/q2Zhbcw40TlxuC1vwKL1_PLZrO0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/outdoor-voices-rectrek-jogger-e804fa48364e4d1b92bc6eefa486cac2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Outdoor Voices</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These joggers are completely weatherproof, so they’re a great pick for all destinations and climates.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>While the exterior is very durable, the interior lining started to pill after three washes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-83 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Most joggers we own are meant for lounging and not much else (case in point: The comfortable <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lululemon Stretch High-Rise Jogger</a>). The Outdoor Voices RecTrek Jogger on the other hand was a fresh take on the classic silhouette that took us through many travel expeditions and climates, thanks to its sporty nylon fabric that was not only soft but also sturdy.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-84 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The exterior of these pants reminded us of a windbreaker — strong and waterproof. Despite the solid material, we never overheated while wearing these. The bottoms were surprisingly lightweight and breathable so we could easily wear them in warm weather, yet they still felt insulated enough to keep us warm in colder temperatures (and in chilly airplane cabins) — paired with a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>lounge-worthy sweatshirt</a>. Along with short car rides, we wore these on a mini adventure to the park, and were able to play in the grass with our toddler without any mobility problems. At five-foot-three, we did find the 27-inch inseam to be a little long, but rolling the waistband prevented bunching around the crotch.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-85 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Because of the style, we wouldn’t consider wearing these to the office by any means, but the bottoms were definitely more structured and elevated than run-of-the-mill sweatpants, and we appreciated that they were wrinkle-resistant. However, the interior lining wasn’t quite as sturdy. After a few washes we noticed that it began to pill. This wasn’t a major issue because the lining hasn’t felt itchy or uncomfortably rubbed against our skin (and the exterior has remained crisp through each wash). But with the price, it was a bit of a bummer. We’re happy to report, though, that the initial pilling hasn’t increased either — the pants still function as if they were good as new.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-86 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Nylon, elastane<strong> | Colors: </strong>3<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-cargo-wondery-isabel-20-outdoor-pants></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Cargo</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Wondery Isabel 2.0 Outdoor Pants</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Wondery Isabel 2.0 Outdoor Pants" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Zm7kGbJxoiDRJ2XUSz0VoMH8uQs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/wondery-isabel-20-outdoor-pants-999976cc33b04f6a99af923175f15b75.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Wondery</p></span><p>Our Ratings</p><ul class=product-record__attribute-ratings-list><li class=rating-list-item><p>Fit</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Comfort</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Quality</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Durability</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4.5</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li><li class=rating-list-item><p>Design</p><p><span class=attribute-rating_value>4</span><span class=attribute-rating_scale>/5</span></p></li></ul><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The six pockets are substantial — they can fit your passport, headphones, wallet, and more.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>You’ll want to keep a lint roller on hand because fuzz and pet hair stick to the pants.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-89 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Cargo pants</a> may have originally been worn by the military, but the sheer amount of functional pockets make them ideal for travel.

The exact number will differ between styles, but similar to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Wayre Jetsetter Trouser</a>, this pair from The Wondery has six: two deep ones in the front, two button-closure compartments on the back, and two massive button-closure pockets on the thighs.

The cinched high waistband fits snugly around our midsection, and, beyond adding a dash of style, the metal side buckles could be easily adjusted to get the perfect fit. But don’t focus on the word “fitted” too much because the waist was the only part of the pants that was very fitted. The legs were looser, especially around the calves, and gave us full range of movement, allowing us to sprint through the airport to reach our gate. The airy cotton fabric also kept us cooler than jeans or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>leggings</a>, so we weren’t a sweaty mess when we boarded.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-91 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Overall, the performance of these pants wowed us so much that we completely ditched our go-to travel leggings.

When it comes to pants, this pair from Quince stood out because of its 100 percent linen makeup, vast color options, and convenient slip-on style, and summer-friendly cropped silhouette. The 25-inch inseam hit us right at the ankle (we’re five-foot-four). Sure, they were a bit longer on our petite frame, but this meant they didn’t drag through dirty airport terminals, and we considered the length ideal for in-between weather days as well as spring and summer travel.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-97 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As expected with linen, the bottoms did wrinkle slightly. But rather than looking disheveled, they had a lived-in appeal. Even with the creases, we still felt they were appropriate for special events, including fancy dinners (and the stretchy elastic waistband made them perfect for meal times). We actually found these to be so comfortable, we completely forgot we were wearing pants (a dream come true). However, the addition of a drawstring would make these bottoms near perfect. The waistband slightly stretches throughout the day, and this small enhancement would keep them fitting perfectly over the course of long travel days.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-98 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>XS–XL<strong> | Material: </strong>Linen<strong> | Colors: </strong>9<strong> | Pockets:&nbsp;</strong>3</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-other-options-you-might-like></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Other Options You Might Like</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Quince Ultra-Stretch Ponte Straight Leg Pant</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a comfortable, office-appropriate pant that isn’t tapered like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Everlane Dream Pant</a>, we loved these <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Quince straight-leg pants</a>.

Over the course of two weeks, each person wore the bottoms while traveling over long and short distances on planes, trains, and automobiles and while going about their daily errands and activities (which included wrangling toddlers, cleaning, and going to the grocery store). We then rated each pair based on fit, comfort, durability, design, and value. We also performed light physical activities (squats and stretches) to see how they moved with our bodies. Once we wore them enough to need a good cleaning, we washed the items at least twice to see how they held up to wear and tear. At the end of our trial, we narrowed down the list to the top-performing travel pants that we now rely on to keep us comfortable through every journey.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-image--instyle commerce-sc-block-image--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>InStyle / Jackie Napalan</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-what-to-keep-in-mind></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>What to Keep in Mind</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Style</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Regardless of how you’re traveling, sitting for hours on end is pretty uncomfortable. That’s why New York-based image and wardrobe consultant Beverly Osemwenkhae recommends opting for travel pants made with an elastic waistband or drawstrings because she says they “give a little more freedom to play around with.” She thinks drawstrings specifically allow you to alter where the waistband sits on your midsection, which can relieve pressure and help you feel more relaxed in transit. You can find these features in many of our picks, but look to our favorite <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lululemon Stretch High-Rise Joggers</a> for the most comfortable.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Material</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While many stretchy materials conform to and move with your body, there are some — like cotton and linen — that can lose their shape over time and wrinkle easily in transit. We felt like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow nocaes">the linen Quince pants</a> looked more lived-in, rather than a wrinkled mess, but that’s fairly rare for linen pants.<strong> </strong>For a more flexible yet sturdy option that’s just as weightless as linen can be, New York-based personal fashion stylist Nejla Renee recommends looking for styles made from spandex, elastane, or nylon because they generally hold their shape through countless washes and wears. Along with their resiliency, these fabrics (as well as most poly blends) are wrinkle-resistant, making them ideal for business trips because they will still look crisp after hours of sitting.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Pockets</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For easy access to your boarding pass, passport, or phone while traveling through the airport, pants pockets help keep everything handy. Not only do they allow you to skip digging through tons of other travel essentials to find what you need, but pockets also give you peace of mind knowing your most important items are for sure on you.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We recommend choosing pants with at least one deep pocket that can hold your phone without it sliding out. But a majority of the picks on our list have much more than one pocket. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">The Wondery Isabel 2.0 Outdoor Pants</a> has six, while the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="nofollow nocaes">Wayre Jetsetter Trouser</a> also features six with one pick-pocket-proof hidden compartment to store valuables. Although Renee and Osemwenkhae say it's not imperative for pockets to have some sort of closure, zippered and buttoned compartments can be a bit more secure.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Versatility</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Sure, comfort tops our list for necessary qualities our travel pants should have. But we also aimed to find pants that are functional and versatile enough to wear on vacation, too. “I like to be able to wear a pair of pants at least two to three times while traveling to optimize packing space,” says Renee.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Think about your destination and what types of activities you’ll be doing to decide what bottoms you’ll wear the most. “Certain pants like jeans are trans-seasonal, [while] trousers can be taken from day to night, spring to summer, and the boardroom to the club if styled accordingly,” says travel expert Thithi Nteta.

Paired with higher sodium intake while traveling, your body is more likely to retain water and bloat while in the air. Compressive garments counter the effects because they “are designed to address venous return and prevent swelling,” she explains.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To ward off bloating, Dr. Splichal recommends wearing compression pants or socks on flights over six hours. “They can be worn on shorter flights if you have a medical condition that contributes to swelling and leg edema,” she adds. For light compression, we recommend our best overall pick <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Lululemon Wunder Train High-Rise Tight</a> because it feels supportive without restricting movement.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you style pants for travel?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-25 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We get it, putting together a stylized outfit for early (or late) departures may not be your top priority, but there are some simple pairings that can transform a groutfit into a cute and comfy ensemble. Renee says that layering is key, even if you’re going to a warm destination because plane temperatures tend to be chilly. She advises styling a high-rise elastic waist pant (like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Wayre Jetsetter Trouser</a>) with a simple cropped tee shirt, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>casual leather sneakers</a>, and a packable puffer. “The puffer can be used for warmth or as a pillow in a pinch,” she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you don’t want to take a heavy coat, opt for something lighter like a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>leather</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>jean jacket</a>. Both options will keep you warm in transit and look more refined than a sweatshirt. But for a dressier option, Osemwenkhae suggests throwing on a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>blazer</a>, especially if you’re headed to a work function directly after the trip. Regardless of which overcoat you select, the jacket and sneakers combo will mesh well with any travel pant style.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">As for accessories, Nteta suggests investing in a nice cross-body or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>belt bag</a> if your favorite travel pants don’t have large enough pockets to store your passport or other items, so you can still keep your essentials at arms reach.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Is it better to wear tight or loose pants on a plane?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">This comes down to personal preference.

Looser styles, like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Cozy Earth Women's Modern Modal Wide Leg Pan</a>, give you a lot of freedom and feel incredibly cozy, almost like a blanket.
