I know everybody and their mother tells us not to pick our zits because doing so will leave behind scars, but I simply can’t help myself.

When I see a big honking whitehead on my face, the only thing I want to do is get that popped and out of my system. But, of course, this leads to the scarring that I’ve been warned about. Is the satisfaction of popping zits worth it? Welllllll, sometimes. Hey, those things can hurt! And I have a product on my side that can help erase those marks fast. And when I say fast, I mean it. After just one use, I noticed a difference in an acne scar overnight.</p><p>Related Stories</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/04/kentucky-derby-2.jpeg> <img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2024/05/buffing-bar.jpg><p>My hero product is <a data-pmc-sp-product=81d383cbde12bfdb6edca94b6bd532cd href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Peace Out Skincare’s Dark Spots Serum","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Peace Out Skincare Dark Spots Serum, 1 fl oz","price":"19.99","id":"B0BGM8C293","category":"Serums"},"id":1258133,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Peace Out Skincare’s Dark Spots Serum</a> . You might know the brand because it produces those <a href=# rel=noopener>TikTok-viral pore strips</a> that suck up gunk like they’re Dyson vacuum cleaners. For the record, the brand has so many other life-changing products, like a <a href=# rel=noopener>retinol stick</a> that makes using the exfoliant so much easier. But, I digress.</p><p>I tested the <a data-pmc-sp-product=3dd846d8385fa0ef04d97ef1ce13b087 href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"dark spot serum","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Peace Out Skincare Dark Spots Serum, 1 fl oz","price":"19.99","id":"B0BGM8C293","category":"Serums"},"id":1258133,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>dark spot serum</a> early before it launched, and let me tell you: This thing is no joke. I first patch-tested it on a new scar on my arm to make sure it wouldn’t result in any weird spots on my face and found that it lightened the area with ease. But the real magic happened when I used it on an acne scar on my face. I used one pump of the product on a particularly dark spot that was the result of some glorious cystic acne that popped up during my period. After just one night, the area was lighter and less noticeable. With a good concealer on my side, I could finally cover the spot for real.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/stylecaster.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/03/Screen-Shot-2022-03-24-at-11.48.29-AM.png><p>The brand calls this a <a data-pmc-sp-product=8e4858336b5ba2298560e928eccb19ac href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"“supercharged” serum","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Peace Out Skincare Dark Spots Serum, 1 fl oz","price":"19.99","id":"B0BGM8C293","category":"Serums"},"id":1258133,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>“supercharged” serum</a> and they’re not joking. This is a seriously potent potion! It’s chock-full of AHAs, chemical exfoliants like glycolic acid that help rebuild collagen production, as well as tranexamic acid, kojic acid and alpha-arbutin. All of these ingredients minimize the look of dark spots, brighten skin tone and even out the tone of your skin.</p><p>Per the brand, this unique formula can treat acne scars, dark spots, age spots and pollution damage. A dream come true.</p><p>I’ve used this on everything from light dots to extremely deep scars and it does the trick each time. For those harsher spots, it takes about a week to heal. I use it every night after my other serums and before my moisturizer and haven’t noticed any bad side effects. Not even dryness. This is a big feat given that my skin gets dry the instant I go outside!</p><p>For the record, the <a data-pmc-sp-product=9be6f7bde41b4e7c961b2d13a2abcc1c href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"vegan serum","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Peace Out Skincare Dark Spots Serum, 1 fl oz","price":"19.99","id":"B0BGM8C293","category":"Serums"},"id":1258133,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>vegan serum</a> lasts a long while. I’ve been using it every night for about a month and I don’t even think it’s anywhere close to done. Be warned: It has an odd smell to it, but that goes away after a little bit. A slight stinge to the nose is fine with me for the incredible impact this has on my face, anyways.</p><p>This is the kind of <a data-pmc-sp-product=71cbc4bc44c7e688f0a4ef846b5ce23d href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"skin treatment","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Peace Out Skincare Dark Spots Serum, 1 fl oz","price":"19.99","id":"B0BGM8C293","category":"Serums"},"id":1258133,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>skin treatment</a> I didn’t know I needed until I started using it. As somebody who suffers from acne and acne scars, it’s heaven-sent. It treats those scars better than anything I’ve tested, and I can’t imagine my skincare routine without it. With this serum in my arsenal, I know that my skin will be glowing and looking as healthy as can be. That’s something to write home about, am I right?!</p><p><a href=# id=auto-tag_shop data-tag=shop>Shop</a> the Dark Spots Serum right this second at <a data-pmc-sp-product=42b2850e028a7fd985c0adbdc743cd7c href=# custom-ga-data='{"1pd":true,"category":"article-page","details":"Amazon","label":"buy-now","event_type_label":"Affiliate","url":true,"product":{"dimension1":"%=href=%","name":"Peace Out Skincare Dark Spots Serum, 1 fl oz","price":"19.99","id":"B0BGM8C293","category":"Serums"},"id":1258133,"location":true}' custom-ga-track=click rel=nofollow>Amazon</a> , <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Sephora</a>, and <a href=# rel="noopener nofollow">Ulta</a>.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmirpK65pq%2FArKueql6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMCstc1mmpqqlWR%2Bc4GXampsZ6CarqSxjKisrWWjoLavr8CrnGackae4br%2FPqKtmq5Wnwq57</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
