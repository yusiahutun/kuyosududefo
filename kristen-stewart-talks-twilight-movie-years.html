I was just working constantly.”</p><img alt="sterben dying premiere 74th berlinale international film festival" title="Sterben (Dying) Premiere - 74th Berlinale International Film Festival" width=683 height=1024 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/kristen-stewart-at-the-sterben-premiere-during-the-74th-news-photo-1712330300.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Isa Foltin</span><span class="css-5ck6gj e1geg53v0">//</span><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v1">Getty Images</span></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">As a solution, Stewart and her coworkers tried to squeeze in more projects whenever they could. “We all, if we were able to, tried to slam one in between,” she said. “That was why it was such a loaded period, because we were either promoting one of these movies, making one of these movies, or trying to shove in something that gave you some variation—not in terms of what it was for other people, but just so you could do something other than play that one part for fucking six years.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">During that time, Stewart sure stayed busy. Besides the five Twilight films, she also appeared in Adventureland (2009), The Runaways (2010), Welcome to the Rileys (2010), Snow White and the Huntsman (2012), and On the Road (2012).</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=7 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">That tireless work ethic has remained with her since the final Twilight film, Breaking Dawn — Part 2, premiered in 2012. Since wrapping up her time as saga protagonist Bella Swan, Stewart has veered further into indie movie territory, taking roles in films like Still Alice (2014), Certain Women (2016), Seberg (2019), and Spencer (2021), the last of which <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/a39549105/kristen-stewart-oscars-2022-chanel-shorts/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="earned her an Academy Award nomination" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">earned her an Academy Award nomination</a> for Best Actress, for her lead performance as Diana, Princess of Wales. However, Stewart has continued to dabble in blockbusters from time to time, like the 2019 remake of Charlie’s Angels or the sci-fi thriller Underwater (2020).</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/04e4fe03-f532-4e6a-8cd4-455131aa4449_1702400410.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Joel Calfee" title="Headshot of Joel Calfee" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Joel is the editorial and social media assistant for HarpersBAZAAR.com, where he covers all things celebrity news.
