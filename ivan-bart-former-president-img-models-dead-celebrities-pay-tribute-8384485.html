He was 60.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The news of his death was announced on <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Bart's Instagram account</a> on Sunday with a black-and-white photo of him captioned, "Our world has lost one of the greats. Ivan Bart, 1963-2023."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">According to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Women's Wear Daily</a>, Bart died Friday following a brief illness.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“It is with overwhelming sadness and deep regret that I share that Ivan Bart, longtime president of IMG Models and a trailblazer in the fashion industry, passed away over the weekend,” Mark Shapiro, president and chief operating officer of Endeavor, which owns IMG Models, said in an email to employees, per the outlet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Over his 30-year career, Bart left an indelible mark on the modeling industry, helping to launch the careers of such iconic names as <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Lauren Hutton</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Kate Moss</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=3>Stephanie Seymore</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=4>Hailey Bieber</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=5>Gigi Hadid</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=6>Ashley Graham</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=7>Gisele Bündchen</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=8>Tyra Banks</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bart, who was born and raised in Brooklyn, N.Y., began his career working for a public relations firm that happened to have a small modeling agency attached to it, giving him a window into the industry. He joined IMG in 1994 as creative director, and worked his way up the ranks before being named president in 2014 after the company merged with WME. Four years later, he assumed oversight of all of IMG's global fashion events including New York Fashion Week.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bart famously championed diverse casting and inclusion, and was also an outspoken supporter of plus-size models.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">“During the course of three decades at IMG Models, Ivan quite literally changed the shape and face of the modeling industry from within," Shapiro's email continued. "His relentless pursuit for diversity and inclusion challenged fashion’s gatekeepers and created household names whose omnipresence has inspired generations."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-20 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">In his message, Shapiro recounted once sitting next to Bart at a table with Victoria's Secret's former management team and politely insisting that they expand their annual television special to include a more diverse cast of models in terms of size, age, race and background.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"He was the voice before there was a voice. He was courageous. He saw beauty in all its forms," Shapiro wrote of Bart.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>PEOPLE's free daily newsletter</a> to stay up-to-date on the best of what PEOPLE has to offer, from juicy celebrity news to compelling human interest stories.</strong></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Ivan Bart in 2019.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anna Webber/Getty Images</p></span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The late modeling executive also embraced the power of social media in amplifying a model's career and giving them a voice. “He knew innately that a picture was worth a thousand words, and the images he helped create became a necessary catalyst for social change,” Shapiro wrote.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Bart stepped down from his role as president in March, becoming a senior advisor at the agency.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Following the news of Bart's death, many of the talented models whose careers he helped nurture paid tribute.
