Luckily, that's what the real Virginia Johnson felt when she showed up for her first day with Dr. Masters, so it worked for me.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Getting serious for a second, Lizzy also told the magazine that it would be 'naive' to think the treatment of women has 'come that far since the 1950s' when her show is set.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'There's nothing on our show around the feminist issues that I don't feel has a huge echo today.

Until we can convince our own side - women - that this is a good thing for all of us, I don't see how we stand a chance convincing all the men.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Being a comedian, Lizzy could not help to lighten the mood mid-interview however, joking about what underwear she likes men to wear.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I like it when guys don't wear those boxer briefs that go to mid-thigh and look like bike shorts. It's harder and harder to find. '</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I prefer old-fashioned tighty-whities or even just boxer shorts. When you discover a man who wears tighty-whities, you hold on to him. It's so old-school.'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>And tighty-whities are not the only thing a guy should have.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'A guy who wants a chance with me has to have a sick and dark sense of humour.</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>'I've had a handful of serious relationships. I take that s**t very seriously.

And what's better than sex?'</span></p><p class=mol-para-with-font><span>Not even pausing, Lizzy responded: 'Immediately. Nah, no one does it immediately. I was very lucky to have an ideal first sexual experience. It was good and sweet and safe. What's better than sex?
