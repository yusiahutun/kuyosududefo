"Jill was like, 'You should talk about this, you should talk about the fact that you dated while you were shooting the show,' which we've never talked about before."</p><p>Prior to the nudge from his wife, Lascher admitted he was "nervous to even ask you if you wanted to talk about it, but we are both happily married and we are adults."</p><p>The former couple further looked back on their relationship and recalled how they bonded over their shared "humor and laughter" while starring on the Nickelodeon show.</p><p>"We would just make fun of everything and everyone in a lighthearted way. We just laughed for two years straight," he said before recalling how he saved up money to buy Taylor a ruby necklace.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:21774ab3-d649-40a5-8aea-05e6528df049 data-container-ref=toofab:article:abeeeb34-c0b8-483b-865d-902c6b04efcc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/2f/5by4/2020/09/25/2ff8786f4eb245688636b6f11407cb1a_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">15 Famous Families With More Than 5 Children</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>"I was head over heels for you!" he gushed while Taylor agreed, "We were head over heels for each other. It was total infatuation for sure... he was my first love and I was so infatuated with you, and loved you so much."</p><p>While the two got "really close" and shared "great" times together, Christine and David eventually parted ways. Looking back now, the actress believes the two didn't last due to the hectic filming schedule that never gave them each time for themselves.</p><p>"I think it was the fact that we were working together and living together in this hotel, we were with each other 24 hours a day, seven days a week, and that's not how young love thrives, you need space to be your own person," Taylor continued.</p><a class="article-block__link js-track-link" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:article:aa8d6580-f653-416b-8b31-350d5af23607 data-container-ref=toofab:article:abeeeb34-c0b8-483b-865d-902c6b04efcc data-context='{"section":"article-block","name":"article"}' readability=27><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/f2/5by4/2022/11/04/f2f32cffb8684bcdbd07ea102c14abb7_xs.jpg width=300 height=240 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center> <span class="media-credit article-block__media-credit">Getty</span><p><h4 class="article-block__card-title article-block__card-title--has-credit">11 Actors Whose Kids Don't Like Watching Their Movies</h4><span class=article-block__cta-text>View Story</span></p></a><p>Though they "kept trying to find our way back to each other," they never romantically reunited after the breakup and continued to work side-by-side after the split.</p><p>"I was terrible," Taylor confessed. "I was so non-confrontational. I probably had no idea how to talk or deal with it. How great is it we can unpack it now?"</p><p>Lascher shared the same sentiments and noted there were never any hard feelings.</p><p>"Everyone has that first love that crushes them, at some point, even though it wasn't intentional," he said.</p><p>"You and I had a friendship that was above and beyond anything else," he continued. "I think the friendship was more important, looking back on it, right? We had such great times together that whatever went on outside of that was less important."</p><p>Eventually, David married London back in 1999 with Christine following suit when she married <a href=#>Ben Stiller</a> a year after.</p><a id=gallery-link-197bc0f3-d98b-40ec-ae73-33272a646de0 class="media-link gallery-block__link js-track-link js-click-gallery" href=# data-node-ref=toofab:gallery:197bc0f3-d98b-40ec-ae73-33272a646de0 data-context='{"name":"gallery-block","section":"permalink"}' data-container-ref=toofab:article:abeeeb34-c0b8-483b-865d-902c6b04efcc data-gallery-layout=carousel><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.toofab.com/image/8c/4by3/2022/12/12/8cf20a616d264fdeafdda9d5ce54b193_md.jpg width=825 height=618 style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></a><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3N7kGtmamxfmLWztdKtoKedXamuurjOq2SdmaaesW64wKyaoZ2iYsCmr9Geq6WxXZmutbHDZp2ipJ2eu6h5x56wZpylmbJw</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
