That’s about one princess every 69 seconds, which is around the same frequency at which you’ll run into someone wearing Sandy Liang while walking around the Lower East Side. “She's a New York princess,” she told me while glancing at the lineup of looks from her show last Sunday.<br></p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=1 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Standing in her studio in a cellar on Rivington Street, just under a ten minute walk from her store on Orchard where the aforementioned Dime Square dynasty congregates, she defined the term. New York Princess (noun): “A New Yorker who wears a full skirt with gingham and layers, styled with their boyfriend's oversized jacket and sunglasses. They think nobody sees them but in reality everyone does. Deep down, they want to be seen, too.” A New York Princess isn’t royalty but has the air of being an heir—not to a throne, but to a cool way of city dressing that feels almost extinct these days.</p><img alt="sandy liang ss23 show model" title="sandy liang ss23 show model" width=3076 height=4614 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sl-s23-look35-1663263153.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Rodin Banica</span><p>The look from Sandy Liang’s SS23 collection that the designer was describing when she thought of the word, "New York Princess."</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=3 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Sandy Liang is a native New Yorker who understands that true New York style looks nothing like a hashtag, and the people who actually embody it are rarely taking those videos of themselves on a subway platform as the train passes (you know the ones). Liang designs for the cool girl who somehow always looks effortless, and is inspired by the experience of living in New York instead of the idea of it.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=5 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">She is also smart. Like, really smart. She went to Stuyvesant, a specialized New York City public high school where you have to score in the top 3% relative to the 30,000 other applicants, on a 3-hour test that’s similar to the SATs, at just 13 years old. While staring at her moodboards—covered in photos of Carolyn Bessette Kennedy, and Will Truman and Grace Adler of the TV show Will & Grace—she called the process of deciding the order of looks that walk down the runway “a big math equation.” And yet she insisted math isn’t her thing: “I know I went to Stuy, but I can't do numbers.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=6 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">One of the <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/street-style/g41096424/after-party-looks-2022-new-york-fashion-week/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="first parties of New York Fashion Week" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>first parties of New York Fashion Week</u></a> was a launch at her Orchard store for her long-awaited ballet Mary Jane Pointe (two years in the making) that looks like a pointe shoe you can wear on the subway. She decided to make 200 in each color, but was worried they’d only sell something like 50, and she wouldn’t know what to do with the rest. Instead, in just two days every color was completely sold out. What Liang might see as proving her alleged mathematic ineptitude is actually genius: she sold just the right amount to create hype for the restock. Personally, the fact that I can't buy a pair in my size right now makes me want them even more.</p><img alt="models backstage at nyfw ss23 show in the mary jane pointe" title="models backstage at nyfw ss23 show in the mary jane pointe" width=3583 height=2376 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sandy-liang-ss23-phoenix-johnson-film-unedited-9-22-61-of-180-1663281772.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Phoenix Johnson</span><p>Sandy Liang models lined up backstage at the SS23 show, wearing the newly launched Mary Jane Pointe.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=9 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The night they sold out, my friend texted me how she wanted a pair, which retail for $495: “They're half as expensive as the Miu Mius!” Indeed, Miu Miu has been making ballet flats since 2016 but its current $950 satin bow version—which debuted on a runway worn with skirts so short and low-rise, Miu Miu panties peek out the top—is everywhere right now. The Sandy girl is definitely also <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/a39542136/miu-miu-tales-janicza-bravo/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="the Miu Miu girl" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>the Miu Miu girl</u></a>; they share an obsessive and off-kilter vision of fashion and girlishness.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Unlike <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/fashion/trends/g40315714/best-ballet-flats/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="other ballet flats on the market" class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60"><u>other ballet flats on the market</u></a>, Liang’s actually looks like a pointe shoe, with a square toe resembling the box of packed fabric ballerinas balance on. “I want to own that toe and just do it across different styles and colors and heel heights,” she said. “I was thinking about the Margiela Tabi, and I own so many Tabis, but whenever a new one comes out I'm like, Fine, I'll get it. I just want that same girl to appreciate this.” At the shoe launch, I overheard a guest in Tabis boasting over buying two pairs, while another complained her size was sold out. Liang clearly knows her girl. She’s also a Gemini, which helps.</p><img alt="nyfw sandy liang ss23 model" title="nyfw sandy liang ss23 model" width=2792 height=4187 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sl-s23-look25-1663269894.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Rodin Banica</span><p>A&nbsp;model wearing Sandy Liang’s just launched Mary Jane Pointe flats with corsage hair accessories, a black bralette, and pleated black skirt.&nbsp;</p><img alt="nyfw sandy liang model walking the ss23 show" title="nyfw sandy liang model walking the ss23 show" width=2911 height=4366 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sl-s23-look3-1663269835.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Rodin Banica</span><p>A&nbsp;model at Sandy Liang’s SS23 show wearing a full khaki look, and Solomon sneakers.&nbsp;</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">“I used to think that was such a weakness when I started designing because I am a New York girl. One day I want to be like this,” she said while pointing to a photo of one of her models wearing a black bralette, a matching low-rise pleated skirt with sheer black socks, and her Mary Jane Pointe flats. “And then the next day, I want to be wearing an oversized baggy jacket with sneakers.” Two photos down from the model she pointed out, there was look three for her show: An oversized khaki jacket with wide-leg khaki trousers, worn with black Solomon sneakers. Absent were the fleeces that have become a signature, which she admitted, “drive the cash flow.” Instead there was an emphasis on tailoring, with cropped baby blue jackets that have long structured bows under the shoulder blades, and cute khaki pleated skirts with white eyelet petticoats spilling out the bottom.</p><img alt="sandy liang model wearing a baby blue suit at sandy liang ss23 show" title="sandy liang model wearing a baby blue suit at sandy liang ss23 show" width=2376 height=3583 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sandy-liang-ss23-phoenix-johnson-film-unedited-9-22-18-of-180-1663282257.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Phoenix Johnson</span><p>Sandy Liang’s take on suiting: A&nbsp;cropped baby blue Peter Pan collar jacket with low-rise trousers, and corsage flower accessories.</p><img alt="a model at sandy liang showing off the blue ribbon details" title="a model at sandy liang showing off the blue ribbon details" width=2376 height=3583 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/sandy-liang-ss23-phoenix-johnson-film-unedited-9-22-17-of-180-1663282352.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Phoenix Johnson</span><p>Two long bows hanging from Sandy Liang’s baby blue cropped suit jacket.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">The show itself was held at a Pace University auditorium, where models walked along a stage to music Liang chose with movie soundtracks in mind. “You know those movies that take place in New York? Where it's the 90s, or early 2000s. You're poor, but you have the sickest Tribeca apartment. The show soundtrack is that soundtrack. It is early technology but also synthy music but also sad.” Let Go by Frou Frou (Garden State!) was the final song, and there were definitely girls in the audience who have had a photo of Natalie Portman's character Sam on their moodboard for years. When the song started playing, I instantly heard someone whisper, “This song was everything to me!” from the row behind mine. As for how she came to the decision to play it, Liang said,“I don't know how to explain it.”</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=18 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">But she doesn’t really have to. It’s obvious Liang viewed each model as a protagonist who would wear a full head-to-toe Sandy look—the first time that’s been possible in the brand’s eight year history, thanks to her shoe launch—to live a life that sometimes involves a 9-to-5 corporate day job, and sometimes involves going backstage at Lincoln Center because your friend just so happens to be a ballerina at ABT. The latter is actually how Liang got inspiration for her Mary Jane Pointe but it’s also the kind of thing that would happen to the girl who wears her clothing, and floats around New York, meeting people along the way. The New York Princess wants to be seen because she loves the way Sandy Liang makes her look, and everyone around just gravitates to her.</p><span class="css-1s9owpq ev8dhu51"><img src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/rover/profile_photos/a3e534fd-dc82-4b22-be80-50efa84b1924_1663767759.file?fill=1:1&resize=120:*" alt="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" title="Headshot of Tara Gonzalez" width=100% height=100% decoding=async style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center></span><p>Tara Gonzalez is the Senior Fashion Editor at Harper’s Bazaar.
