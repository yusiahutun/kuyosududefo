She was known as the Queen of Country. She has an incredible talent.</p><p>She just never done this before and that was going to be hard because she was joined by Niall Horan for his sophomore season as well as Gwen Stefani and John Legend. The last two were true veterans.</p><p>They’ve both competed on this show several times in the past. They’ve even won one here and there. Although, no bit of experience could truly prepare them for the first contestant tonight. Their singer/innovator auditioned with Reba’s song. And she made it sound like an original song.</p><p>Tonight was a hell of a tribute. – Our first one up was Jordan Rainer. She was from Oklahoma. She now lives in Nashville and her rendition was right up Reba’s alley. Reba naturally turned for her. She also faced stiff competition when Gwen, Niall, and John also turned for her. Jordan was a four chair turn. They all loved her style. They later came to love her humor too. Jordan was quite funny. She moved to Nashville with a man and a dog. She still has the dog and she wasn’t heartbroken over losing the man. Nor did she mind telling jokes about it.</p><p>Jordan is a true trooper. She had her parents there in the audience supporting her. It therefore came as a surprise to anyone that Jordan chose the Queen of Country. Reba couldn’t wait to use her on her team. She also couldn’t wait to reward her with tater tots. Reba’s nickname was tater tots. It was given to her by her boyfriend and so she was handing out tater tots to everyone who made her team. Next up was Josslyn Rose. She came from a family of eleven. She has her mom, dad, and eight sisters. Her parents were longtime foster parents. They fostered countless number of children over the years. They were currently fostering three kids now.</p><p>Josslyn auditioned with the song “Arcade”. She was a young kid. Just a teenager. She dreamed of being a singer/songwriter one day and was hoping the show would bring her one step forward to that. Only she’s never experienced the real heartbreak that goes into that song. She still gave it her all. She may not have loved a boy that way, but she did love her music that way. That’s what helped her to gain confidence in the song. It even led to three of the coaches to turning for her. And John came to regret being the sole person not to turn in time for her.</p><p>Gwen, Niall, and Reba all turned for her. They all wanted her to join their team and she ultimately chose to go with Gwen. Gwen was more aligned with her interests. Regardless of Reba having more experience than the other three. She still chose Gwen. Reba also had to learn how to fight against the three. She lost out on Josslyn. She also lost out on Deejay Young. Deejay Young has been living out of a suitcase because he’s been traveling around the country performing “Hamilton”. He’s played every part he could. And his versatility came in handy tonight.</p><p>Deejay performed “This Woman’s Work”. He gave a brilliant falsetto and he knew how to hold a high note. He was another three chair turn. John, Gwen, and even Reba turned for him. They all loved his voice. Reba also wanted to show that she could coach more than just country musicians. Except Reba lost out against when Deejay went with John. Reba wasn’t the sole legendary figure tonight. She was competing against three well-known contestants. Next up was Sophia Hoffman. She performed “Tell Me You Love Me”. This was her second time auditioning on the show.</p><p>Sophia auditioned last season only no one turned for her. She also chose a very different song at the time. She chose a Spanish song back then and tonight she went with a Pop song. Niall and Reba both turned for her. And the queen lost out again. Sophia went with Niall and she was the perfect example of someone returning to reap the glory. Niall really had someone good with that pick. Next up was Sam Dearie. He was a college kid with an old soul. He loved the original ratpack. He loved the old style of music.</p><p>Sam could be a great Elvis impersonator. He even auditioned with the song “Walkin After Midnight” with an Elvis take to the song. His song felt untamed. It sounded like his voice still needed work and so that’s why no one turned for him tonight. He can always come back. Like Sophia did. He just has to work on choosing the right song. Song choice was half the battle and it could sink anyone if they don’t get it right. Then there came Jackson Snelling. He was adopted along with his brother by a very caring couple. And his adopted father had sadly passed away when he was seven.</p><p>Jackson has epilepsy. His parents would take turns sleeping with him to make sure he was safe asleep. It was his dad’s turn when Jackson woke up and he found his father unresponsive. Jackson has never forgotten that moment, but he lives his life the best he could in hopes of making his father proud of him. He auditioned with the song “If Heaven Wasn’t So Far Away”. It was a Country song. He was a Country musician. He got both Gwen and Reba to turn for him. Gwen tried sell her pitch. She brought up Blake and everything. And still she lost out to Reba because Reba was Queen of Country for a reason.</p><p>Reba also pulled her out crown and scepter. She was now ready to throw down with the best of them. Next up was Alexa Wildish. She was a new age hippie. She lived out her van all throughout 2021. She loves nature. She loves waking up to mountains. She was also a huge fan of Reba’s. It was her dream to one day work with Reba and so she wisely chose the best song she could find. She chose “Songbird” by Fleetwood Mac. Her voice was so graceful that all four judges turned for her. Alexa could have chosen anyone and she surprised everyone when she chose Niall.</p><p>Remember when Alexa said she loved Reba most of all. Well, it turns out choosing Niall was right with her spirit, so she claimed. She chose him without thinking and her spirit felt lighter. Olivia Minogue was next. She auditioned with the song “Lay Me Down”. She was a three person turn. The only one that didn’t turn was Gwen. Gwen missed out on an opportunity only she never had a chance to begin with. Olivia has loved Niall since 1Direction. She even had a singing toothbrush with his music and so of course she went with Niall.</p><p>Next up was Jarred Billups. He lived in a place called the Sticky City. It was nicknamed that way because a certain maple syrup was made there and so his small town wasn’t quite so small. Only Jarred grew up on the poorer side. His family constantly struggled throughout his childhood. He was now a music teacher. He loves to play classical music in his class because he wants to make sure that everyone gets to hear all types of music. He was a good guy. He just wasn’t at his best tonight. His song choice was wrong for him.</p><p>Jarred had chosen “Let’s Stay Together”. It was a great song. It just didn’t let him show off his full range. Next up was Kristen Brown. She was originally a part of a band and she left them to go solo. She now performs all of her own music. She auditioned with the song “Blown Away”. She put her own spin on it because she was a songwriter and she won two judges. Both Gwen and Reba turned for her. They both made great pitches. Kristen struggled with picking one side and she chose Gwen because Gwen really fought for her. Gwen came out swinging on this one.</p><p>Reba was disappointed to have lost out on a Country artist. But it’s just Night 1. She still has several other ways to keep fighting and there were plenty of talent left. Next up was Mara Justine. The young lady fell in love with singing when she was eight and she has never turned back. Her mom got her singing lessons when she was younger. Her mom has often encouraged her to be adventurous and now she has to be adventurous for the both of them because her mom was recently diagnosed with breast cancer. And so it was with her mother in mind that she auditioned the song “Goodbye Yellow Brick Road”.</p><p>Mara was a four chair turn. She was twenty-one and was from New Jersey. She was a part of a large Italian family. She was used to making herself heard, but she let the judges fight it out for her. Niall borrowed Blake’s giant foam finger. Gwen practically begged for her. Reba pointed out where she could help Mara get even better. And John literally started singing with her to “All Of Me”.</p><p>And Mara was still struggling to choose her coach when tonight’s episode came to an end.</p><p>THE END!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLHLnpmdoaKpxq2t1Kebq7FemLyue5FpaWxnpJ2ybsLOopqeZaCnsq61xKucZqqVmK6xeY9yZGttXWeAbr%2FEmqqopl1ngW6xz6KqqJyVYn5uwMeeZJukmaOxbq3UnaCtoZ%2BjwHA%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
