Never buy anything until you have considered what you will be wearing it with. The good news is we live in a messed-up world. All the rules seem to have gone out the window. No, I’m still talking about jackets, people.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">For years, women have been wearing them how­ever they please. Some, such as American actress Blake Lively, have repeatedly forgone the bottom half altogether. Her recent appearance at Cinema­Con, in Las Vegas, was in a Sonia Rykiel double-breasted, navy tuxedo jacket marketed as a mini dress. Jason Wu, Theory and Boohoo all do “blazer dresses”. Make wise lingerie choices on the day, please.</p>Many a fashion blogger pairs their favour­ite jacket with cut-off jeans. We like the neatness of Chloé’s tailored, dark indigo denim shorts with contrast cream stitching (HK$6,000). The pre-frayed type is widely available, too, by brands such as Topshop (HK$349 and up), Frame Denim (HK$1,450; Lane Crawford) and M.I.H. Jeans (HK$1,358; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Net-a-Porter</span></a>).Moving towards decency, you could pair your prized purchases with trousers; create contrast with print or a different colour. Although wide-legged trousers are de rigueur, a straight or slim leg line will look better on 99 per cent of you. Whatever your preferred type of trouser, you’ll find them all at By Malene Birger (HK$1,705 and up; Net-a-Porter). Feminine dresses, such as Alessandra Rich’s tea gowns (HK$16,830 and up; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Farfetch</span></a>), are another popular item to pair with the mascu­linity of a jacket.<img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/cdn4.i-scmp.com/sites/default/files/images/methode/2018/05/09/e692dd56-5289-11e8-a252-5c54534dd764_1320x770_151939.jpg><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">It’s a bit of an odd question but where can I get a yellow necklace? It’s for a party with a yellow, black and white theme. I don’t even like yellow and it looks terrible on me!</strong></p><p>Yellow, Hello NO, Central</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31"><strong data-qa=ContentSchemaRender-defaultRenderMapFunctions-Component-0 class="css-1mniedq eq9i94316">The Dictator:</strong> Good idea. Yellow doesn’t suit you, so wear it as close to your face as possible. If you were wise, you would skip the necklace entirely. Wear a yellow belt. No, wait, I forgot most women don’t show their waists any more. Banish the yellow then, to your feet, with a pair of shoes. Not listening, are you? Fine. Les Nereides does sophisticated, “Citrine Yellow” hand-faceted glass and gold-plated brass necklaces, from a 38cm choker (HK$1,250) to a longer, opera length of 80cm (HK$5,700).</p>Really, the least you could have done would have been to tell me more about the party. For example, if you’d said it was a kid’s construction site party, I’d have sent you to a local hard­ware store for some of that plastic chain they sell for a pittance. Or maybe an ele­vated version to suit other occasions, too, such as Alexis Bittar’s lucite link necklace (HK$2,069; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">Nordstrom</span></a>).Isabel Marant has added flowers to her spring/summer 2018 chain-link plastic necklace (HK$8,594; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">matchesfashion. com</span></a>). Marni’s jewellery has a sort of luxe arts and crafts look about it – you might like this season’s geometric formations of yellow, black and white plastic beads on a red leather cord (HK$3,900). You might also like Tina Lilienthal’s tropical quartz bib necklace in white quartz with neon-yellow perspex (HK$3,124; <a rel=nofollow class="euc41pk0 e13op9j60 e1qbu6wp1 css-jgjyn2 ef1hf1w0" href=# data-qa=BaseLink-renderAnchor-StyledAnchor><span data-qa=Component-Text class="css-0 e1qbu6wp0">anthropologie.com</span></a>). Mixing colours is a cunning way to be on theme, but maintain your yellow-despising integrity.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7tK%2FMqWWcp51kuqKzwLOgp52jZL2wv9NmpJqfka%2B2r7GOn5isoJmku3Ct0a2gnKSVZH9ygJRqa3JnkqGurLGMpaCvnZyuwG6%2FxLGwZpmemXq0u8%2BhoKysmZiutbHDZpmlmaqav26w0Z6qrA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
