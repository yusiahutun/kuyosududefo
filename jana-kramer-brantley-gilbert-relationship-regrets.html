The two quickly began dating and were engaged about six months later, in late January of 2013 — but their relationship ended that August, when they called off their plans to marry.</p><p>Now, both Kramer and Gilbert are married to other people — her to former NFL player Michael Caussin, him to his hometown sweetheart Amber Cochran — but in <a href=#>a new episode of her podcast</a>, Kramer admits that if she were to text an ex one last time, she'd be sending the message to Gilbert. It seems she has some regrets about the way&nbsp;things went down in that relationship.</p><p>"I'm really sorry for the person that I was," Kramer admits, "and the way that I wasn't healthy enough to be in that relationship."</p><p>The conversation came up during&nbsp;the April 19 episode of her podcast,&nbsp;Whine Down With Jana Kramer and Michael Caussin, in which the couple discusses a&nbsp;USA Today&nbsp;story about texting exes one final time "just in case you have one more thing you wanted to get off your chest," Kramer summarizes.</p><p>Caussin thinks it's a bad idea — you're either texting them something pointless, or to say you miss them, he theorizes — but Kramer&nbsp;timidly brings up Gilbert's name.</p><p>"I wasn't the best version of myself in that relationship. I just wasn't," she says, at first being coy about which former relationship she's discussing. "I always have a little bit of regret that I didn't handle things better."</p><p>"That's adult and mature of you," Caussin agrees, to which Kramer quickly interjects, "Well, we're not going to reach out to them, because that wouldn't be healthy."</p><p>Kramer and Caussin have been married&nbsp;since 2015 and have two children together. The couple has&nbsp;been forthcoming about the issues they've worked through in their relationship, including his infidelity and treatment for sex addiction. They were separated for a time in 2016, but reconciled and renewed their wedding vows at the end of 2017.</p><p>Gilbert and Cochran, meanwhile, have also been married since 2015, and they, too, have two children together.&nbsp;<a href=#>Gilbert admitted in 2014</a>&nbsp;that while he still thought the world of Kramer, "[w]e went for broke, man. We went hard, we went fast ..."</p><p>"Some things happened, and it didn’t work out," he added at the time.</p><p><strong>These Country Star Breakups Left Us Reeling:</strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmo5melnqsvsCmnKtlkqeur8DLnrBmn5mhr6a%2B02apnqSRqbawutKhoKllopq0s7HTrGY%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
