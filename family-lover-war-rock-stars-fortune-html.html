She is even out of pocket over the cost of Robert's funeral."</p><p>The crisis has arisen because the Swiss courts may not recognise Palmer's final will, which was in Mary's favour.</p><p>Now, the singer's children by his ex-wife Sue - Jane, 24, and James, 25 - are fighting for control of his estate.</p><p>The smooth, smart- suited crooner - whose hits include Addicted To Love and Some Guys Have All The Luck - found romance with Ohio-born Mary, then a waitress, after his 21-year marriage broke up.</p><p>He was divorced in 1993, and Sue got a £5million settlement.</p><p>A friend of Mary tells me: "Robert absolutely adored her. He made a will years ago when he was living in the Bahamas when he was married, but later he crossed out his wife's name and wrote in Mary's.</p><p>"He had it all witnessed, but for some reason the way he did it may not be acceptable to the Swiss courts."</p><p>Switzerland does not recognise 'common-law wives', and the will is going to be the subject of a bitter court case.</p><p>While the struggle goes on, accountants have frozen Mary's credit cards, and she has been cut off from access to Robert's estate and future earnings from his back catalogue. The friend adds: "I am horrified. Robert would be turning in his grave. He and Mary were never apart for more than a day for the entire time they were together."</p><p>Who says the Queen hasn't got a sense of humour? When oily French President Jacques Chirac comes to stay at Windsor Castle next month, he will be treated to a special performance of the hit West End musical Les Miserables. It is being staged in the Waterloo Chamber - which is dominated by a giant portrait of the vanquisher of Napoleon, Duke of Wellington.</p><p><strong>Why Julien has BA girls blushing</strong></p><p>He is one of the brightest young stars of British fashion, but Merthyr Tydfil-born designer Julien Macdonald - whose dresses have been worn by Joan Collins and Naomi Campbell - has suffered an unexpected setback. The 30-year-old confirmed bachelor from the Welsh valleys, whose father worked in a Hoover factory, was signed up to create a stylish and sexy new look for British Airways stewardesses.</p><p>Alas, the outfits have led to red faces - and leering passengers - for the dresses are prone to splitting.</p><p>As the stewardesses sashay down the aisle, their skirts have an embarrassing tendency to catch on the seats and tear. The problem with the uniforms - launched with a massive media blitz in April - has led to a flood of comments on BA's internal staff website.</p><p>One stewardess said: "I caught my skirt badly on an armrest and it ripped right up to the zip, much to the amusement of the passengers around me and my very red face.</p><p>"Luckily, I had a sewing kit. I had to remove myself from service and go to the loo to sew it up." Julien's spokesman tells me: "This is the first we have heard of it ." British Airways assures me that the problems with the skirts have now been fixed.</p><p><strong>Chris takes it off the chin</strong></p><p>There have been some hair-raising moments in music mogul Chris Wright's life. At 50, he cut off his hair and now, to mark his 60th birthday, he is shaving off his trademark beard.</p><p>The multi-millionaire boss of Chrysalis Records - and owner of Wasps rugby club - has been bearded since contracting appendicitis while touring with a band in San Francisco in 1970. "I've had a beard for 34 years and at my birthday party my daughter, Chloe, began collecting bids from people suggesting I shave it for charity," he tells me. "It seemed churlish not to agree."</p><p>Chloe, 25, a lawyer with City legal firm Harbottle And Lewis, says: "I have sent round an e-mail asking for pledges to either Warchild or for children in Beslan. Donors will get a photograph of my father's chin, and a few beard clippings.</p><p>"At the moment, we have raised about £10,000. Poor Dad is terrified."</p><p><strong>PS</strong></p><p>As if the BBC won't have enough people in America for the Presidential election, there will be a special edition of Question Time broadcast from Florida next week.</p><p>The panel will include various American bores - anti-Bush obsessive Michael Moore and Clinton-apologist Sidney Blumenthal - as well as a token Brit, the always watchable Richard Littlejohn.</p><p>"We're joking that it's only being done because David Dimbleby (the presenter) has got to be in the U.S. for election night and doesn't want anyone else doing his show too well back in London," says a comradely fellow broadcaster.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pa3IpbCmmZmhe6S7ja6iaJufocKuusisq6xnkafBqq%2FLnmRsamNlhXJ7pZqkoqSpYrmwwsSrZLCZomK%2FsK%2FKZqqtmaKoeqe70a2sp51encGuuA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
