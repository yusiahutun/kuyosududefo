The bike gives you the experience of pleasure and adventure while enjoying the scenic beauty at the same time. Nobody will disagree with me if I say Harley Davidson bikes are the best in the world.</p><p>Their motorcycles are the perfect combination of a beautiful body framework, excellent engineering, and a smooth ride. Hardcore bike lovers, when looking to buy a motorcycle, often don’t settle for anything less than Harley. In this article, we’ll take you on a ride to show the journey of Harley Davidson from a bicycle brand to a motorcycle legend loved by all.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Competition with Global Market</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/1.jpg><p>Founded in 1903, Harley Davidson is one of the few American companies that survived the Great Depression in 1930. It was established in one of the towns in the United States of America named Milwaukee in Wisconsin. The company experienced multiple changes in terms of leadership and subsidiary arrangements. When there was serious competition in the global market, especially from Japan, Harley Davidson saw its poor quality bike production in the market. However, it did not affect the ever-growing graph of the company’s success. Harley Davidson inspired more bikers across the world and people started joining its fan club, showing off their bike riding skills.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Rising through War Time</h2><p>The origin of the company can be traced back to 1901 when William S. Harvey decided to use a small engine capable of displacing 116 cc flywheels for manufacturing pedal-powered bicycles. For another two years, William, along with his childhood friend Arther Davidson kept on tinkering with the engine. The journey of one of the most iconic motorcycle manufacturers in the world began when the process of engine-making was finished. When the USA decided to participate in the First World War, the demand for motorcycle users increased. Harley Davidson sold more than 15000 motorcycles to the US military during the war.</p><p>In fact, during Second World War, the government again asked Harley Davidson to serve in the military. The company provided more than 90,000 motorcycle bikes to the military, probably one of the highest demand to date. However, when American Machine and Factory purchased Harley Davidson in 1969, the company lost its reputation for manufacturing reliable and quality motorcycles. The American Machine and Factory reduced the mass production of bikes and fired most of the workers which lowered the bike quality and made them inferior to their Japanese counterparts. Soon, the company became bankrupt and it was difficult for it to survive. However, the veteran didn’t bog down and kept coming back, ultimately making way for itself in the market again.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Pioneer of ‘Chopper Motorcycles’</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/2.jpg><p>In the beginning, Harley-Davidson manufactured large, air-cooled cruiser motorcycles with powerful engines with a minimum displacement of 700cc. This model of motorcycles brought the trend of the “chopper” motorcycle style that underwent mass production and was customized to complement the rider’s desires and specifications. They were well-known for the personalized bike specifications company offered for buyers.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Popular Models of Harley Davidson</h2><ul><li>Harley Davidson Fat Boy 114</li><li>Harley Davidson Sportster S</li><li>Harley Davidson Street Glide Special</li><li>Harley Davidson Pan America 1250</li><li>Harley Davidson Nightster</li></ul><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Ravishing Retro Looks</h2><p>One thing that fascinates most people about Harley-Davidson bikes is their retro look. In addition to customization, the company wants its customers to enjoy the retro look which takes them back into the era and relives nostalgia. The company is acknowledged for durability, comfortable ride, and most significantly, the reliability of its engines because safety is everything. Most of the bikes have an engine above 700cc segment and use the V-twin engine which is a perfect blend of power and longevity.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>Marketing Strategies</h2><p>There are different marketing strategies that worked well for Harley Davidson and made the company what it is today. They include:</p><ul><li><strong>Freedom and Individualism:</strong> Harley has always portrayed itself in the ads as a free bird. It characterized the quintessential value of human beings like freedom and individualism. The way its brand is different, it shows how every rider is different. This strategy gave bike owners a wide canvas to explore who they are.</li><li><strong>Symbol of Courage</strong>: Harley and Davidson created sports bikes in an era when there were no proper roads and racing tracks. Both of them went ahead and dared to innovate something that was way ahead of the time. It was a courageous thing to do that, and today, road trips with Harley are encouraged as a lifetime adventure.</li><li><strong>Listening to Customers:</strong> What makes Harley Davidson different than its competitors is that it listens to its customers and respects their opinions. The company undertakes surveys to collect data about customer preferences. They call it ‘real-time market research.’ The research provides a unique approach to studying customer behavior.</li><li><strong>Focused on Creating Own Community: </strong>Harley Owner Group (HOG) is a sponsored community marketing club which is operated by Harley Davidson. It is for those enthusiast bike riders who are loyal customers of the company. The group promotes company products as well as encourages a posh lifestyle.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/theenterpriseworld.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/06/3.jpg><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Statistics of Harley Davidson Bikes:</h3><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Revenue Totals for the last five years</h4><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody><tr><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>Annual Revenue</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>$5.775 billion</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>$5.335 billion</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>$4.045 billion</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>$5.361 billion</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>$5.716 billion</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h4 class=wp-block-heading>Harley Davidson Motorcycle Sales in the last five years:&nbsp;</h4><figure class=wp-block-table><table><tbody readability=2><tr readability=4><td><strong>Year</strong></td><td><strong>USA</strong></td><td><strong>Canada</strong></td><td><strong>Europe, Middle East, Africa (EMEA)</strong></td><td><strong>Asia-Pacific</strong></td><td><strong>Latin America</strong></td></tr><tr><td>2022</td><td>109190</td><td>7924</td><td>30510</td><td>27905</td><td>2922</td></tr><tr><td>2021</td><td>125713</td><td>8005</td><td>30907</td><td>25020</td><td>3652</td></tr><tr><td>2020</td><td>103650</td><td>6477</td><td>36906</td><td>27220</td><td>5995</td></tr><tr><td>2019</td><td>125960</td><td>8946</td><td>44086</td><td>29513</td><td>9768</td></tr><tr><td>2018</td><td>132868</td><td>9690</td><td>46602</td><td>28724</td><td>10167</td></tr></tbody></table></figure><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Keeping up with the Quality</h3><p>Harley-Davidson is one of those brands in the market that has good manufacturing quality and designs that fulfill the requirements of customers at a low cost.
