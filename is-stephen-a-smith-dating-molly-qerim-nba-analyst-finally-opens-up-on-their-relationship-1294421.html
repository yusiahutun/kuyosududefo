Chris “Mad Dog” Russo initiated the topic by humorously suggesting Smith and Qerim had tied the knot, based on their matching white attires. Smith admitted that he and Qerim dressed attractively but dismissed Russo's comment as a jest.

Smith gave an odd clarification regarding rumors about his alleged&nbsp;romantic relationship with host Molly Qerim.&nbsp;</p><p>Chris “Mad Dog” Russo initiated the topic by humorously suggesting Smith and Qerim had tied the knot, based on their matching white attires. Smith admitted that he and Qerim dressed attractively but dismissed Russo's comment as a jest.</p><p>“No, nothing is going on!” Smith said. “You understand what I’m saying? America’s been lying about that for a couple years.” Smith refuted. Qerim backed him up, noting that many fans had fallen for the hearsay. Russo chimed in, "Indeed they have, and I constantly get inquiries about the 'celebrity couple'."</p><p>Smith then leveraged the context to drop a self-praising comment. He explained, "On the positive side, this indicates their perception of my high standards, which is flattering for her. And obviously, she has excellent taste too. So it seems like a way for America to applaud our good looks."</p><p>Qerim, who stood by with a confused expression, received an unexpected reply from Smith.</p><p>He asserted, "However, the rumors do reinforce that First Take is the best show not only regarding content but also in terms of presentability." Russo was left bemused by Smith's audacious interpretation. <a rel=nofollow href=# class="looms--artdiv loomsart--logodiv loomsart--logodiv-v2" onclick='trigger17LoomsEntryClick("17Looms_AP_Logo","-","-","-")'><img src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.pinkvilla.com/assets/images/17looms_pinkvilla_deshtop_article_entry_updated.jpg alt style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></a></p><span class=f14>Advertisement</span><p><strong>ALSO READ:&nbsp;</strong>A<a href=# onclick='triggerArticleInterlinkClick("article_interlink_click","Is Stephen A Smith Dating Molly Qerim?
