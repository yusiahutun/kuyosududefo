"We keep investing in our brands. It is critical to keep on the forefront of technology."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">About US$1.4 billion of last year's US$4.3 billion revenue was derived from new products of various brands, including industrial power tool label Milwaukee, AEG, power tools and outdoor power equipment brand Ryobi, and floor care labels Hoover and Dirt Devil.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The products are widely sold by retail giant Home Depot in the United States.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Net profit at Techtronic, one of the largest power tool makers in Dongguan, an industrial hub in Guangdong province, leapt 24.5 per cent last year from 2012 to US$250 million.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Revenue jumped 11.6 per cent from a year earlier, while gross profit margin rose by 0.7 percentage point to 34.2 per cent.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The firm is one of the few surviving players in the PRD, the reputation of which as the factory of the world shows signs of rust amid protracted labour shortages, constantly rising wages, shifting industrial policy and an exodus of exporters from the mainland to lower-cost Southeast Asian countries.</p><figure data-qa=Component-StyledFigure class="css-1yuz473 exv1azg4">We are not a big fan of workers.&nbsp;We constantly automate areas [to] add valueStephan Pudwill,&nbsp;Techtronic</figure><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">The PRD is striving to move higher up the value chain with enhanced technology and more environmentally friendly products. For Techtronic, this means a greater use of automation at its production base, which employs about 8,000 migrant workers, down from about 11,000 in 2011.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We are not a big fan of workers," Pudwill said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We constantly automate areas that can add value."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Despite relying largely on growth from innovation in its existing business, Techtronic is open to expanding via mergers and acquisitions, he said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A case in point was the purchase last year of Oreck, a US-based manufacturer of vacuum cleaners, primarily for the hotel industry.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"We don't need to do M&As in order to expand the company, but it does not mean that we are not looking at any opportunities," Pudwill said.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Analysts at HSBC estimated Oreck would generate about US$80 million in revenue this year, compared with about US$30 million last year.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">HSBC recently upgraded its net profit forecast for Techtronic to US$309 million this year from US$308 million and to US$369 million next year from US$366 million previously.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Identifying business opportunities that will complement the group's operations is a key responsibility of Pudwill, who stands to take over the firm from his father.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">Pudwill, 37, joined the group 10 years ago and became an executive director in 2006. He had previously worked in product marketing and strategic planning at Mercedes-Benz in Germany.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">At Techtronic, Pudwill said, "I work closely with [chief executive Joseph Galli] and my father and am actively involved in all areas."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">He does not think his father, who is 69, will retire in the near future.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">"Sometimes, I have different opinions with my father, which is healthy," Pudwill said. "It's important to have different opinions and think differently."</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">In the past year, Techtronic shares have soared 39.04 per cent to HK$25.50 yesterday and outperformed the benchmark Hang Seng Index by 38.72 per cent. The stock closed at an all-time high yesterday, up 3.23 per cent from Thursday, extending its bull run since the firm announced better-than-expected 2013 full-year financial results in March.</p><p datatype="p" data-qa=Component-Component class="e15kmbpe0 css-1c6uqr6 e1346ty31">A recent Citi research report expected the stock will consolidate for a short while before hitting fresh highs later this year.
