"I race historic muscle cars back in Australia. And I try to race home as soon as I'm finished a movie but don't tell anyone," reveals the star.</p><h2>Eric Bana's early life</h2><p id=eVijF_M23459 data-wc=33>Born Eric Banadinovich, the son of a Croatian father who worked for an American tractor company and a German hairdresser mum, the young Australian first became interested in showbiz after discovering Richard Pryor.&nbsp;</p><p id=epd0FcZFu4 data-wc=36>And it was the American comic's stand-up routines which inspired Eric to develop his own repertoire of impressions and voices. Dismissing the idea of formal training, the self-taught actor began his career as a stand-up comic.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eric Bana's early career</h2><p id=eGOq2dkdPQ data-wc=91>In the early 1990s, he cut his teeth in the industry by performing in bars and clubs across Australia. "I didn't study in the traditional sense, but I studied in a much harder way I learned everything that I had to learn on the job, and in public, standing up in front of 200 strangers every night in a different town," he says. "I'll never forget those days they were really exciting. You learn a lot about yourself when you're on the road, and going through gig after gig after gig."&nbsp;</p><p id=ecfNgUF1zm data-wc=74>Eric scored early successes thanks in large part to his keen wit, with the popularity of his stand-up routines paving the way for a series of TV roles in sketch programmes. He proved a natural, and his prowess led to him landing his own comedy show in 1997. Soon being touted as Australia's next big thing, Eric had to bide his time, however, before breaking out as a leading man on the big screen.&nbsp;</p><p id=eGNzOA6Bp4 data-wc=32>After a series of smaller roles the Aussie hunk finally scored a break-out hit as the notorious thug Mark "Chopper" Read in the 2000 indie film adaptation of Mark's best-selling memoir, .&nbsp;</p><h2>Career</h2><p id=e8Xl-7r0wEa data-wc=46>To pack on the 30lbs he needed to play the rotund criminal, Eric went on a four-week junk-food diet. His commitment was rewarded. In addition to earning critical praise for his portrayal of the criminal, he also received an Australian Film Institute nomination for Best Actor.&nbsp;</p><p id=eXz_sIas5_ data-wc=51>By then a household name in his homeland, Eric began to set his sights on establishing himself on the international stage. The opportunity arose when Ridley Scott offered him the role of an American sergeant in , the 2001 Oscar-nominated film detailing a near-disastrous US military mission in Somalia.&nbsp;</p><p id=eWjpW6DvfEV data-wc=88>But it was 2003 which turned out to be the real "banner" year for Eric, with the 6ft 4in actor becoming an international sensation after director Ang Lee cast him as Dr Bruce Banner in a big screen adaptation of Marvel Comics' . The film's success led to him being offered the role of Hector opposite <a aria-label="Biography of Brad Pitt" class=hm-link href=#>Brad Pitt</a> in the 2004 summer smash . Despite his meteoric ascent to international stardom, the proud father of two has not forgotten his roots and is still based in Australia.&nbsp;</p><h2>Eric Pana's private life</h2><p id=eAAMggasCW data-wc=46>It was right before his breakout that Eric met and married Rebecca Gleeson, a former publicist who had worked at the same broadcasting network as the actor. The couple have two children, son Klaus, who was born in 1999 and daughter Sophia, who arrived in 2002.<br></p><p id=eQ73D9xkOPk data-wc=82>Home for the Bana family is the southern city of Melbourne, where, when not filming, Eric pursues his passion - racing bikes and cars. The self-professed "rev-head" takes his sport seriously, making his motor-sport debut in 1996's Targa Tasmania and participating in the 2002 and 2003 Classic Adelaide competitions. Eric is "like the old-time movie stars," says his director Curtis Hanson. "He's grounded in an adult way. He loves his home, his family, his motorcyles and cars. He's a man."&nbsp;</p><p id=eyn5j4oUguQ data-wc=31>The talented thespian, often described as "humble" by his co-stars, consciously avoids Hollywood. "I deliberately fly in and out of LA for as small a time as humanly possible," he admits.</p><p id=e4LMpT0c5zJ-8 data-wc=55>Home really is where Eric's heart lies. "When I go on the plane to fly home, I'm literally capable of forgetting what I do for a job," he says. "That also comes about because I choose to take massive breaks between projects, and because I choose to do this ridiculous thing of keeping home, home."</p><span class=linklistStyleTwoTitleClass_lag0e70>More Profiles:</span><span class=linklistStyleTwoLineClass_l1uyevmm></span><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfpb%2BwssilnKxnYmV9en2PaW9saGJksrO1wmaZmqaRZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
