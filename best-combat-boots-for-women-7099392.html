Designed originally for the military, they feature a thick sole and higher shaft that laces up to the top. Now, celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Taylor Swift</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Blake Lively</a> are bringing these staple stompers back in a major way. But they aren’t all designed equally — from materials to heel height, finding the perfect pair that also fits in your budget can feel almost impossible.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-1 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">To find the best combat boots, we scoured the market and tapped personal stylists for their favorites, too. (If you’re always lusting after combat boots but never know <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>how to build an outfit around them</a>, we have tips on that, too.) We also asked podiatrist Dr. Farah Alani how to make sure you’re investing in comfortable boots that will “last for years and years and years — provided you take care of the soles.” Below, find our full list, from classic <a href=# class=pseudoStyle data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Dr. Martens</a> to bold styles from Prada.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-overall-dr-martens-1460-smooth-leather-lace-up-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Overall</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Dr. Martens 1460 Smooth Leather Lace-Up Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Dr. Martens 1460 Lace-Up Boots " style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/JWCTCstt6ZBf6qv8fNcaGQ3HD5Y=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/dr-martens-1460-lace-up-boots-43598248eaee4a6eba9246a70eacc7a2.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Dr. Martens</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The matte finish and distinct design make these a breeze to style.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There are no half sizes, which can make finding the right fit a little tricky.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-2 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With their bright yellow stitching and unmistakable silhouette, Dr. Martens boots are classic. The company makes dozens of unique pairs and patterns, but we keep coming back to these simple black boots that basically style themselves. The low heel means they’re just as practical as they are timeless, while the matte leather looks cool and undone no matter what’s on top.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The brand’s signature heel loop at the back makes it easy to slip the 1460 Boots on. And the solid rubber outsoles have great traction, for easy wearing in all kinds of weather. Pair them with <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>your favorite sundress</a> or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>your go-to jeans</a> — either way, you can’t go wrong. We only wish the style came in half sizes for a closer fit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–14 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather, rubber | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-budget-torrid-stevie-lace-up-combat-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Budget</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Torrid Stevie Lace-Up Combat Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Torrid Stevie Lace-Up Combat Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/y1IEdD9woobnCiK3VzVmBcelkHU=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/torrid--stevie-lace-up-combat-boot-149701d59a9e44ffad4ee15edda0e969.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Torrid</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With laces, zippers, and elastic, these boots are ultra-comfortable.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There’s only one width.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">“Just because it is cheap doesn’t mean that it looks cheap,” New York-based personal stylist Nejla Renee tells InStyle. Genuine leather combat boots can be expensive — but there are plenty of alternative budget-friendly styles available if you know where to look. Torrid is a go-to brand for size-inclusive fashion stylist Heensie Low, and the stylish Stevie Lace-Up Combat Boot tops our list for its low heel height and price.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Laces, zippers, and elastic panels make these boots ultra-comfortable. Even better, Low likes that the style is available in an extra-wide width. (If your feet are narrow, we recommend the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="nofollow nocaes">Adalante The Elena</a> boot instead, which comes in a narrow width.) Choose from basic black or a distressed brown that pairs well with shearling jackets and slouchy sweaters.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6–13 | <strong>Material:</strong> Faux leather | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 1 inch | <strong>Colors:</strong> 2</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-luxury-prada-leather-pocket-combat-booties></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Luxury</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Prada Leather Pocket Combat Booties</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Prada Leather Pocket Combat Booties" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/pgbEMuO8rP2SooEPlz0zBQABiic=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/prada-leather-pocket-combat-booties-12d18d3725d84de0b9030cd0c8f44ee4.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Bergdorf Goodman</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These unique boots feature removable pouches and a statement sole.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They may run small.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>An InStyle favorite</a>, the Prada Monolith 55 Leather Combat Boots have a thick, chunky sole and removable, zippered pouches that set them apart from other pairs on our list. Made from leather and rubber, they’re built to withstand heavy wear — as celebrities like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>Selena Gomez</a> have proved time and time again.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While they may look heavy, we’ve stomped around Europe in these for 12 hours with no blisters or chafing. Available in sleek black, bright white, neutral beige, or statement olive green, the Monolith comes in a chic neutral hue that blends into almost any wardrobe. They’re also available in half sizes, although you may want to order one size up for the right fit.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–11.5 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather, nylon, rubber | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 2.3 inches | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-waterproof-sorel-caribou-x-boot-lace-wp></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Waterproof</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sorel Caribou X Boot Lace WP</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sorel Caribou X Boot Lace WP" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/p6w3SIzfnm3PmB6s0GTbax_IDt8=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sorel-caribou-x-boot-lace-wp-73dc0f33acad43f6be002c06ca9468d1.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zappos</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>There’s a wide range of bright color combinations to choose from.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>While the boot itself is waterproof, the laces aren’t.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The seam-sealed Sorel Caribou X Boot Lace WP is built to repel rain, ice, and snow with ease. With a striking silhouette and multiple neon color combinations to choose from, it’s both trendy and practical (unlike many other waterproof boots). However, it’s worth noting that the laces aren’t waterproof, so they may need to be replaced more often in very wet weather.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For anyone with flat feet or high arches, the Caribou Boot has a removable midsole so you can add your own insoles if needed. A 1-inch platform means you stay high above mud and dirt, while snow cuffs keep your socks feeling warm and dry. Pull these on for a coffee run in a blizzard and know that you’re covered.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-19 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–12 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather, textile, synthetic, foam, rubber | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 1.5 inches | <strong>Colors:</strong> 5</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-leather-frye-veronica-combat-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Leather</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Frye Veronica Combat Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Frye Veronica Combat Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/-d4w9wzQnjhnhS9H3aLNsw51TyA=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/frye--veronica-combat-boot--1994b62cb60e46dd8f0cbb8ed02b9eaf.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Frye&nbsp;&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The genuine leather construction make these boots both durable and timeless.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They can feel heavy, and they tend to run small.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you’re looking to spend a little more on genuine leather boots, Frye has you covered with the Veronica Combat style. The classic shape will still be relevant season after season, making these a great investment. They also have adjustable laces and pull tabs at the heel, for easy wearing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Since these are real leather, they will feel heavier than other faux options on our list. Some wearers have also found that they run small and narrow, so you may want to order a half or full size up from your usual. But we love that they’re available in so many colors, from distressed black to burgundy to floral embossed options.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5.5–11 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 1.25 inches | <strong>Colors:</strong> 4</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-black-steve-madden-brody-black-combat-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Black</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Steve Madden Brody Black Combat Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Steve Madden Brody Black Combat Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/O_bH3Z17Yg8S4vOinrjiLd15vt0=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/steve-madden--brody-black-combat-boot-7c57d713d9a94ee3aa9601e0a624c048.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Steve Madden&nbsp;</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The large grommets and shiny toe cap make these budget-friendly boots look high-end.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The laces can’t be adjusted.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For a black combat boot that’s anything but boring, the Steve Madden Brody Black Combat Boot is the best pair we’ve found. The large grommets and shiny toe cap make these different from most other combat boots. The platform sole and contrast stitching are reminiscent of Dr. Martens, but the side zipper means these boots are much easier to slip on and off.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-29 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Modern and elevated, the Brody pairs well with everything from <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>wide-leg jeans</a> to <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=2>pleated skirts</a>. The subtle design is sure to earn you compliments and double-takes on the street. These boots are also one of the less expensive ones on our list, although we wish the laces could be adjusted or re-tied.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–12 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather, synthetic, textile | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 1.75 inches | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-most-comfortable-blundstone-lace-up-gore-boots></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Most Comfortable</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Blundstone Lace-Up Gore Boots</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=500 data-sizes=750px alt="blundstone lace up gore boots" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Yd0ohIFqFA25fsyiZh1sa6VN4XM=/fit-in/1500x500/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/blundstonegoreboots-46064ea282804257aa2f4268fe27ab23.png"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Anthropologie</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>With a convenient, slip-on design and great shock absorption, these are an everyday staple.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>There’s only one width.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-33 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">For combat boots you don’t have to break in, try the Blundstone Original Lace-Up Gore Boot. They have a soft footbed that feels comfortable right away, with superior shock absorption to protect your joints from the impact of walking on hard concrete and floors all day long.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Easy to dress up or down, this pair slips on and off in seconds thanks to elastic panels on each side (no laces needed). Water-resistant leather and a steel shank inside also make them incredibly durable. We love the Oat color for an unexpected twist, although there are plenty of hues to choose from. They’re only available in one width, but the brand says you can order a half size up for a wider fit.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>6–11 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather, synthetic, polyurethane | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> Not listed | <strong>Colors:</strong> 6</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-lightweight-vionic-lani-combat-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Lightweight</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Vionic Lani Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Vionic Lani Combat Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NpckMAbGrS9bfgaua0TYKyC8Exs=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/vionic-lani-combat-boot-8772289a5aa64bfaa400e23bab974efb.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>These boots have earned the APMA Seal of Acceptance, meaning they’re backed by podiatrists.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The toe box may be too long for some.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Weighing in at 11 ounces each, the Vionic Lani Combat boots are one of the lightest pairs on our list. But they’re still made with comfort in mind: These boots have earned the American Podiatric Medical Association’s (APMA) <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nocaes>Seal of Acceptance</a>, an award given to shoes that promote better foot health as determined by a panel of podiatrists.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-39 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Water-repellent with great arch support, these combat boots will quickly become your go-to’s for walking in bad weather. And with leather and suede options in a range of neutral tones, there’s a pair to match every style. The Lani’s lightweight design also makes them a great choice for traveling since it won’t seriously weigh down your suitcase or <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>weekend bag</a>. But some reviewers note that the toe box is long, creating some extra space in front of their toes.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather, synthetic, foam, rubber | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 1.3 inches | <strong>Colors:</strong> 9</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-flat-feet-taos-footwear-womens-groupie-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Flat Feet</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Taos Footwear Women’s Groupie Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Taos Footwear Women&amp;acirc;s Groupie Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/5lZKdyz8yZ3xSzbr418KfpnDFWQ=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/taos-footwear--womens-groupie-boot-774b0b2b1f2d4aeba4ebc9b487e12e85.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The soft, faux fur lining gives these a major upgrade.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>These boots only come in one width, so they’re not ideal for wide or narrow feet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-43 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Flat feet and fallen arches need some extra TLC in the form of supportive shoes, like the Taos Footwear Groupie Boot. Sometimes it’s all about the look, but these combat boots are big on comfort, too. The midsole has two kinds of foam and built-in arch support, plus a faux fur lining and leather footbed that sets it apart from our other picks. Tired of flat boots causing cramps in your arches? These are roomy enough for you to add your own insoles.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-44 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The Groupie Boot comes in beautiful neutral shades that already look worn in — including navy, which can be tricky to find. Style the pair with a flannel and jeans in cooler weather or with an oversized <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>leather jacket</a> when you want to make a statement.

The insoles have a thick layer of memory foam that absorbs shock, even on your 10,000 step days. And the brand pays attention to detail: Both the interior and exterior are made of leather, for a more durable construction that won’t fall apart after one winter.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-54 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">We like that these come in half sizes, but you may want to order a size up for your usual since they tend to run narrow.

Every piece is completely black, for a minimalist take on a rugged combat boot. We like that the 2.75-inch heel feels elevated, but the style isn’t so over the top that you can’t wear it to the office or happy hour.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-59 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Also worth noting: The stacked heel is on the thicker side, which makes it easier to walk in (and lowers the chances of a heel snapping when you least expect it). Plus, the laces can be adjusted throughout the day, as your feet start to swell. But you will have to lace the shoes up every day since there’s no zipper, and the style also runs narrow.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Size: </strong>5–10 | <strong>Material:</strong> Leather | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 2.75 inches | <strong>Colors:</strong> 1</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-platform-sam-edelman-lovrin-platform-combat-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best Platform</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>Sam Edelman Lovrin Platform Combat Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="Sam Edelman Lovrin Platform Combat Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/Tq4HUwOOLcqUSy9ihSmtvrkV3O4=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/sam-edelman--lovrin-platform-combat-boot-e037cd21ecc045d3b1ba2383e5e65036.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Amazon</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>The bold design is sure to turn heads.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>The extra-chunky sole may not be for everyone.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-64 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Make a statement with the Sam Edelman Lovrin Platform Combat Boot.

Side zippers and heel pull tabs allow you to quickly slip these on and off. Since these boots aren’t made from leather, they can scuff easily, but we think this is a fair trade-off for their unique design and budget-friendly price tag. Throw them on with a flowy dress, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>linen pants</a>, or your choice of light and breezy summer essentials.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-72 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Sizes: </strong>5–11 | <strong>Material:</strong> Synthetic | <strong>Heel Height:</strong> 2 inches | <strong>Colors:</strong> 8</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-best-for-winter-aldo-marni-hiking-boot></span><p><h2><span class=product-record__superlative-text>Best for Winter</span></h2></p><p><h3><span class=product-record__heading--text>ALDO Marni Hiking Boot</span></h3></p><img width=1500 height=1000 data-sizes=750px alt="ALDO Marni Hiking Boot" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src="https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.instyle.com/thmb/NvV0nKggAvF7tQlReNFaBBwskSE=/fit-in/1500x1000/filters:no_upscale():max_bytes(150000):strip_icc()/aldo--marni-hiking-boot-095ed5a043b64c9bbf19421bd59a9ac0.jpg"> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Zappos</p></span><p><strong>What We Love: </strong>Soft fleece and a slight heel give these a boost over traditional snow boots.</p><p><strong>What We Don’t Love: </strong>They’re heavier than most other boots on our list.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_2-0-75 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">With a thick sole and fuzzy fleece accent, the Aldo Marni Hiking Boot was made for trekking through snow. Many winter boots are stiff and plain, but these take cold-weather style to the next level.

Be wary of boots you have to “break in.” Alani says that squeezing your feet into too-tight boots can cause blisters, bunions, and hammertoes over time. When shopping, she recommends making sure your boots are wide enough, with a tall toe box that has plenty of space for your toes.&nbsp;</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-3 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Alani also suggests trying new boots in-store at the end of the day, when your feet are at their most swollen. This way, you can get a better idea of how comfortable they really are (and hopefully prevent painful blisters later on). As a last resort, you can ask a cobbler to stretch a leather boot out or add more cushioning to the insole, she adds.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-4 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Comfort</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-5 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">While the right fit goes a long way in <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>making sure your boots feel comfortable</a>, there are a few other details you can look for. Alani recommends buying boots with laces that can be adjusted throughout the day if needed, like our best overall pick, the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Dr. Martens 1460 Greasy Leather Lace Up Boots</a>. Elastic on the sides can prevent your boots from feeling too stiff, while a wider design leaves room for any movement or swelling, she explains. And if you have high arches, Alani suggests looking for an extra tall toe box that can accommodate your foot shape. For a boot with all of these features, try the <a href=# data-component=amazon data-source=affiliate data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Blundstone Original Lace-Up Gore Boot</a> — our pick for the most comfortable combat boots on the market.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-6 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Materials</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-7 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If your goal is to invest in combat boots that will last for years, it’s important to consider which materials the upper, midsole, and outsole are made from. The uppers (or exteriors) of most boots on our list are leather, which is fairly durable and wears well over time. The midsole, or the part of the boot your foot rests on, should be thick and padded to help absorb shock and protect your knees, Alani says. Most midsoles are made from foam, but you can always add your own insole if you need more cushioning or arch support. And don’t forget the boot’s outsole, or bottom — does it have enough traction for walking in wet weather, like our best for winter pick, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored nofollow noskim">Aldo Marni Hiking Boot</a>?</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-your-questions-answered></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Your Questions, Answered</span></h2><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-9 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Which combat boots are the best?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-10 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The best combat boots are comfortable, stylish, and well-made. Which pair is right for you depends on your foot shape, arch type, and your personal style. Make sure to shop for boots with features that match your lifestyle: If you live in a wet climate where <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>rain boots</a> are a wardrobe staple, go for waterproof styles — and if you walk a lot (especially on uneven ground), you may want to aim for a lower heel height.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-11 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How do you style combat boots?</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">The styling possibilities for combat boots are seemingly endless. Both Low and Renee love contrast styling, or using combat boots to give romantic, feminine outfits a more masculine edge. Low recommends pairing your boots with trousers or slip skirts for an elevated look. Or, try Renee’s foolproof formula of combat boots underneath a floral dress. You can even leave them unlaced at the top and wear them with leggings or jeans for a more casual vibe, she adds. And when it comes to white or pastel combat boots, Renee suggests adding light wash jeans, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>faux leather joggers</a>, or cropped trousers to shake up your usual outfit formulas.&nbsp;</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-subheading--instyle commerce-sc-block-subheading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>How long should a pair of combat boots last?&nbsp;</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">If you wear them regularly, Alani says a pair of combat boots should last between 400 and 600 miles of walking. Unsure how much mileage you’ve put on your current pair? She recommends placing your boots on a flat surface (like a shelf) and looking at them from behind. If you see signs of wear or uneven spots on either side of the heels, then it’s time to resole or replace them.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-why-shop-with-us></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-15 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-heading--instyle commerce-sc-block-heading--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Why Shop With Us</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block litho-sc-block commerce-sc-block-html--instyle commerce-sc-block-html--carbon-base commerce-sc-block-html mntl-sc-block-html">Contributing commerce editor <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>Sarah Felbin</a> loves her Dr. Martens combat boots for walking around New York City, rain or shine.
