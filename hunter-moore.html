For the crime he did, he is being called “the most hated man on the Internet” by Rolling Stone. He posted pictures of many people with their real names and addresses. He went to earn income from his website and kept running the content for at least 16 months.</p><p>Hunter Moore is in the news as of July 2022 because he was publicized in a docu-series on Netflix. The series rated Netflix among the top 10 with third place. It is said that Moore was first asked whether he wanted to publicize himself in the series. Initially, Moore agreed but later he refused. The fact is Moore got jailed for the crime he did but after fulfilling the imprisonment and giving the fine, he is now a “Free Man”.</p><h3>Early Life</h3><p>Hunter Moore was born on 9th March 1986 and was brought up in Woodland, California. He went to Woodland Christian School where he studied but was later expelled (the reason is being unstated).</p><h3>Hunter Moore Career</h3><p>Moore began his website in 2010 in the wake of earning a livelihood and the site was originally intended to produce “nightlife” based content. After he and his friends received sexually explicit pictures from the women they were hooked with at the time, he started posting the content on his website. Soon, he changed his website content and started posting photos or videos of people who were not professionally modeled. Besides posting their pictures without their consent, Moore also linked their pictures with their Facebook and Twitter accounts.</p><p>After many subjects were outraged, the boyfriends and girlfriends of those people (who were posted on Moore’s website) started hacking the website’s content and using the pictures for their criminal intentions. Many of those pictures and videos were posted in the wake of revenge from their ex-partners. Soon the website developed the name “Revenge Porn” from “Is Anyone Up?” After getting publicized, many people objected to the content and multiple letters were sent to Moore to which he would simply reply “LOL” and used to say that the laws of Facebook protest him.</p><h4>Social Media Outrage</h4><p>Moore’s website “Is Anyone Up?” attracted around 30 million page views and it made him earn around $8,000 to $13,000 a month in ad revenue. Moore became the exclusive talk of the town and was named “the hated man on the Internet” by Rolling Stone. He was banned from Facebook. Eventually, Moore got caught by the FBI and faced numerous lawsuits. Once he was stabbed with a pen by a woman who was supposed to be featured on his website.</p><p>Feared by the lawsuit and the threats of death by various people, Moore was accompanied by his grandmother and for a period he stayed with her. He feared he would be murdered because of the continuous death threats. Then a time came when Moore finally sold his website to an anti-bullying group for $ 12,000. After the website was sold, all the pornographic content on the website was cleared or deleted by the group. Anyone who now tries to open Moore’s website isanyoneup.com, they are redirected to Bullyville.com.</p><h4>Jail or Imprisonment</h4><p>Initially, Moore refused to bring down the content on his website on various requests. He called himself “a professional life ruiner”. He took the hold of the website and ran it for around 16 months during which he would state that he was protected by Facebook laws. The case reached the FBI and the investigations started in 2012 after one of the victim’s mothers reached the FBI with lots of proof and evidence. After seeking the investigations and seeing the proof, the site was closed in April 2012 and was sold to an anti-bullying group. Moore pleaded guilty and charges were made against him. In November 2015, Moore was sentenced to jail for two years and six months with a $2,000 fine, and $145.70 in restitution. Later, he was released in May 2017.</p><table><tbody><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Hunter Moore Biography</h3></th></tr><tr><td width=40%>Real Name</td><td width=60%>Hunter Moore</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Date</td><td>9 March 1986</td></tr><tr><td>Age (as of 2022)</td><td>36 Years</td></tr><tr><td>Birth Place</td><td>Sacramento, California, United States</td></tr><tr><td>Profession</td><td>Webmaster</td></tr><tr><td>College</td><td>Woodland Senior High School</td></tr><tr><td>Qualification</td><td>Graduate</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Physical Statistics</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Height</td><td>in feet inches&nbsp;<strong>– 5’ 10” – </strong>in Centimeters <strong>– 178 cm</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Weight</td><td>in Kilograms&nbsp;<strong>– 75 kg&nbsp; –&nbsp; </strong>in Pounds&nbsp;<strong>–&nbsp; 165 lbs</strong></td></tr><tr><td>Hair Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td>Eye Color</td><td>Brown</td></tr><tr><td colspan=2><img decoding=async src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wealthyspy.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/08/Hunter-Moore-2.jpg alt width=960 height=721 sizes="(max-width: 960px) 100vw, 960px" style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto></td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Family</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Father</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Mother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Sister</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><td>Brother</td><td>–</td></tr><tr><th colspan=2><h3>Relationship Status</h3></th></tr><tr><td>Marital Status</td><td>In Relationship</td></tr><tr><td>Affair</td><td>No</td></tr><tr><td>Who is his girlfriend?</td><td>Kirra Hughes</td></tr></tbody></table><h4>Netflix Docu-Series</h4><p>In 2022, Netflix made a docu-series based on Moore.
