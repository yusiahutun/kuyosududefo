It looks like not everyone is caught up on the Marvel Cinematic Universe -- or at least not current &#34;Jeopardy&#34; contestants.
On Monday's episode of the syndicated game show, none of the three contestants -- E.J. Wolborsky, Josh Levit or Debbie Kauffman -- seemed to know who the current Spider-Man is, actor Tom Holland."><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/normalize.css><link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css?family=Open+Sans:400,700" rel=stylesheet type=text/css><link rel=stylesheet href=https://assets.cdnweb.info/hugo/cayman/css/cayman.css><link rel=apple-touch-icon sizes=180x180 href=./apple-touch-icon.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=32x32 href=./favicon-32x32.png><link rel=icon type=image/png sizes=16x16 href=./favicon-16x16.png><link rel=stylesheet href=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.css integrity=sha384-yFRtMMDnQtDRO8rLpMIKrtPCD5jdktao2TV19YiZYWMDkUR5GQZR/NOVTdquEx1j crossorigin=anonymous><script defer src=https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/katex@0.10.2/dist/katex.min.js integrity=sha384-9Nhn55MVVN0/4OFx7EE5kpFBPsEMZxKTCnA+4fqDmg12eCTqGi6+BB2LjY8brQxJ crossorigin=anonymous></script>

Returning champion, Wolborsky, gave his attempt, answering "Who is Toby MacGuire?" Kauffman didn't answer.</p><p>See how it went down, below.</p><p>Although "Jeopardy" contestants get answers wrong all the time, Holland's fans on Twitter couldn't wrap their heads around the fact that none of the competitors answered correctly. Not only has Holland portrayed "Spider-Man" since 2016 when he first made his MCU debut in <a href=#><strong>"Captain America: Civil War,"</strong></a> but the British actor has reprised the character in three Marvel films: <a href=#><strong>"Spider-Man: Homecoming,"</strong></a> "Avengers: Infinity War," and <a href=#><strong>"Avengers: Endgame."</strong></a></p><p>Not to mention Holland's fifth appearance in the comic book saga, "Spider-Man: Far From Home" has been advertised everywhere as of late -- the film hits theaters July 2.</p><p>Because of this, fans were seemingly shocked "Jeopardy" players didn't know who Holland was and some even took offense to it. People also pointed out the obvious promo plug for "Far From Home." (Disney owns Marvel Studios and ABC, the network where "Jeopardy" airs.)</p><p>"I'm appalled. Tom Holland deserves better," a person wrote.</p><p>Another added, " 1) This is some solid in-game film advertising 2) YOU DUMB PIECES OF SHIT"</p><p>Check out how fans reacted in the tweets below.</p><p lang=en dir=ltr>The <a href=#>#Jeopardy</a> clue was a video showcasing the <a href=#>#SpiderManFarFromHome</a> trailer seeking the name of the actor who plays Spider-Man.</p><p>First person buzzed in and said “Garfield,” second said “Maguire,” and the third elected not to buzz in.</p><p>I'm appalled.
