She appeared in The Phantom Menace. But which role did she play? Let’s take a closer look at Coppola’s career, her net worth, and the part she played in the epic beginning of the Star Wars saga.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-sofia-coppola-is-a-successful-director>Sofia Coppola is a successful director</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-1><p></p></figure><p id=par-3_66>Coppola is the daughter of Hollywood royalty: director Francis Ford Coppola. He directed legendary films like Apocalypse Now as well as The Godfather Part I and II. He even cast his daughter as Michael Corleone’s daughter in The Godfather Part III. Like her father, Coppola is also a director. While she couldn’t stylistically be further from her father, her films are just as compelling and interesting.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-4_60>According to her <a href=#>IMDB</a> profile, Coppola’s first feature film was called The Virgin Suicides starring Kirsten Dunst. Her first breakthrough hit was 2003’s Lost in Translation starring Scarlett Johansson and Bill Murray. For that film, she earned an Academy Award for Best Screenplay. She’s had several other critically acclaimed films since then including Marie Antoinette, The Bling Ring, and Beguiled.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-5_23>Coppola’s proof positive that sometimes, cinematic talent can in fact run in the family. So how successful has her career made her financially?&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-what-is-sofia-coppola-s-net-worth>What is Sofia Coppola’s net worth?&nbsp;</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.cheatsheet.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/03/sofia-coppola.jpg><p id=par-6_58>Coppola may have had a leg up when it came to getting her start in Hollywood, but nobody can deny her sheer talent. That’s why she’s been such a success over the years, and it’s led to some pretty serious riches for the filmmaker. According to <a href=#>Celebrity Net Worth</a>, her net worth is estimated to be $40 million.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-7_49>Through the years, along with her acting and directing, Coppola has also modeled. In the early 90s she posed for YM and Seventeen, two magazines focused on a teenage audience. She also starred in an off-kilter show on Comedy Central called High Octane. The show only lasted four episodes.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-8_45>Coppola also appeared in The Phantom Menace, which shouldn’t come as much of a surprise. Her father was good friends with Star Wars director <a href=#>George Lucas</a>. You may not have recognized Coppola if you weren’t watching closely, however, as her role is easy to miss.&nbsp;</p><h2 id=h-who-did-sofia-coppola-play-in-the-phantom-menace>Who did Sofia Coppola play in ‘The Phantom Menace?’&nbsp;</h2><figure class="wp-block-embed is-type-video is-provider-youtube wp-block-embed-youtube wp-embed-aspect-16-9 wp-has-aspect-ratio" id=emb-3><p></p></figure><p id=par-9_79>The Phantom Menace was one of the most heavily anticipated films of all time. After a 16-year hiatus on the big screen, Star Wars was back in theaters and fans couldn’t wait. While reviews were mixed, there’s no question the film had a major impact. It helped launch the career of Natalie Portman, the actor who played Queen Padme Amidala throughout the prequel trilogy. Portman’s look-alike Keira Knightly portrayed one of her handmaidens in the movie as well.</p><p id=par-10_23>But Knightley wasn’t the only notable name playing one of Padme’s helpers. Coppola also played a handmaiden named Sache, according to <a href=#>The Wrap</a>.&nbsp;</p><p id=par-11_63>Coppola’s role wasn’t a big one, and if you blinked you may have missed her. She wore a heavy cloak in the film and played a minor, non-speaking part. But it was clear that acting wasn’t Coppola’s true calling. Only four years after her role in The Phantom Menace, Coppola directed Lost in Translation which would open up her career as a director.&nbsp;</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7pLTEmqusoJWawW%2BvzqZmnqakmr%2B1rcinpJ6mpGTBqbGMqZ%2BapqSkum65xKeYnJ1drLWwecOim2arn5u2onnCqKepp5yWerG4wLJkoqZdqMGivoywmKurXp3BrriO</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
