But it's not just Kris, Kim and co!&nbsp;</p><p id=e0taqlX5vz data-wc=138>Lady Gaga, Eva Mendes, Taylor Hill, Miley Cyrus and Sofia Vergara are all big fans - let's put it this way, his clinic is the hottest destination in Hollywood, and his Coolaser treatment is a huge hit - but at £5,000 a go, it's not cheap. If you don't have access to Beverly Hills or a celebrity's bank balance, you're in luck because Dr Simon Ourian has spent millions on AI technology with his business partner. That's right, you can now get your skin analysed (we've tried it, and yes it's fantastic) and get prescribed targeted products from the Simon Ourian M.D. skincare line. You can't beat having access to the world-leading cosmetic dermatology doctor through an individual virtual consultation powered by the latest AI, it’s just like meeting him in his Beverly Hills practice, but for free!&nbsp;</p><p id=eBES6PoyCs data-wc=36><strong>Hi Dr Simon Ourian, it's SO exciting to talk to you today! You're a skincare god when it comes to the celebrity looks in Hollywood… What's been your pinch-me moment with any of your celebrity clients?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e3bXm9V1cWc data-wc=84>"I got very lucky early on. What I was doing resonated with a lot of celebrities but back then it was very hush-hush. No one was talking about treatments! They were secretly coming in through the back door in the evening so no one would see them. But the pinch me moment was when Lisa Vanderpump started working on The Real Housewives Of Beverly Hills, she really talked about what she was doing and was very open about getting botox and procedures like that.</p><p id=eykqFZjDdD4 data-wc=23>"After that, <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>Lady Gaga</a> was instrumental, talking to her friends and bringing her friends over and being open about what I was doing.&nbsp;</p><p id=eLlr8W0OCK2 data-wc=74>"But around the same time, and probably the best thing that happened, was when <a class=hm-link href=#>Kim Kardashian</a> walked in and brought all the media attention with her. People saw her before and after treatments in real time. Her sisters of course; Kylie, Khloe, Kourtney and all of them have been in my office, and Kris of course, they've all become dear friends and through their generosity and support they have created longstanding pinch me moments."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/db9c7df1c1ba-dr-ourian-lady-gaga.jpg><p id=ekL7MLvuARV data-wc=34><strong>Ah yes, you have famously worked with the Kardashians… is there anything you think people don't know about their skin? They all look so perfect and pristine on the show and on social media.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e6mPt2qMNHO data-wc=85>"It doesn't happen overnight. A lot of effort and time and energy goes into this. They're always under the microscope and have all the media attention so they have to look their absolute best. They make a living partly through their looks and how they appear. They have ups and downs just like everyone else; they have blemishes and Kim has been very open about the fact that <a class=hm-link href=# rel=noopener>she has psoriasis</a>, it's not as glamorous as you might think. They're very hard working &nbsp;- 24/7."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/bc5dcc6e8f8c-kardashians-gettyimages-1186863332.jpg><p id=eQpDV6Jxeih data-wc=15><strong>What advice do you tend to give them when they're working a lot or travelling?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=ezlwCDcnExE data-wc=99>"I think being healthy and getting off the plane healthy is the most important thing - wearing flight stockings and walking around the plane for journeys that are more than two hours. Besides that, for your skin, it's important to keep your skin hydrated and moisturised. The cabin is very dry - keep moisturising your skin with a good moisturiser that your skin is not going to be irritated by, especially around your eyes and your neck. Drink plenty of water which is very very important and add electrolytes with it. No alcohol or little alcohol is key, too."&nbsp;</p><figure class="quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-healthandbeauty -style-2"><p id=ev3Umnee2F_>"Drink plenty of water which is very very important and add electrolytes with it."</p>Dr Simon Ourian MD</figure><p id=e3tBr4mARaU data-wc=30><strong>Kim recently raved about the non-surgical laser skin resurfacing facial she had with you? What are the benefits of a treatment like that and who would it work best on?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eXrgr_tb5NT data-wc=84>"She's talking about Coolaser which is a state-of-the-art advanced laser that we offer and can work for anyone over 30, or if you have skin discoloration, if you have ageing, if you need your skin to become tighter especially around the eye or the mouth. The recovery time is pretty quick, just a day or two. The day Kim had this she was being photographed two days later with full-on makeup. It has really similar results to a real laser but with minimal downtime."</p><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eVp8pME0gZ- data-wc=10><strong>Is that the next 'must have' skincare treatment for 2024?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eB7T7tLewiK data-wc=183>"Coolaser, for me, will be the number one treatment because it's so quick and the results are so fast. You can get it done and go back to the office or go home. I'm also very biased and think my new skincare line has some of the ingredients people are going to be looking for, such as STABLE Vitamin C and Hyaluronic Acid in their skincare products. The AI technology, which we have been very excited about in a very nerdy way, which <span><a class=hm-link href=# rel="sponsored noopener nofollow">we have introduced to our skincare</a></span> is exciting. The advantage of that is that you can take a picture of your face and it does an analysis of your skin in a real way, not in a hocus pocus way, but a real analysis of your skin and it can tell you with very high accuracy - better accuracy than most doctors, including myself, can do by relying on our experience and our vision. It can tell what the problems are with your skin and tell you what to do. I think that's the biggest advancement we'll see in 2024."</p><figure class="quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-healthandbeauty -style-2"><p id=e3fSQdriO9tb>"Coolaser, for me, will be the number one treatment because it's so quick and the results are so fast."</p>Dr Simon Ourian MD</figure><a href=# style=text-decoration:none rel="noopener noreferrer">View post on Instagram</a>&nbsp;<p id=eNQc09mV74u data-wc=15><strong>On the subject of your skincare line, what's the one product that everyone should try?</strong></p><p id=eFvXnTKk1BI data-wc=91>"Wow, it's like choosing between your kids, but I think the one that most will love will be our boosters in general. Depending on what your skin concern is - and at any given time, each of them will help in a certain way. But for everyone, I recommend to start a routine which is basically cleanse, tone and moisturise and sun block. If you have that routine down, you'll be doing 95% better than everyone else on the planet. You can then add a Booster to make your skin better."</p><p id=ezb19v3WRoB data-wc=12><strong>Skin boosters seem to be so popular right now, why is that?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eraJyGt6K0v data-wc=29>"Boosters are very concern orientated so they go exactly after the problem you have.

We do a little bit of Coolaser once or twice a year, we do Stem Cell once or twice a year to really build up the collagen. Of course, she has her daughter's skincare line, but I always help and advise her when she's after more pharmaceutical-grade stuff. We often mix and match.

We spent millions of dollars, ahead of every major skincare company that's out there who have a lot more money than we do. One of my co-founders Dan is even more geeky than I am and he wanted to have something that was very advanced and pushed us to put a lot of money into AI that can take a photo of your skin and with a very high certainty it can tell you the issues of your skin, and it's up to you if you want to address all of them at once or which bothers you the most. We've had nothing but glowing feedback. It works with you, if you take another picture a month later it can tell you the improvements you've made and what to work on. It's like having your own personal physician in your pocket."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/de32048b7d8c-ai-technology-tried-and-tested.jpg><p id=e_rlRd_3Zv1 data-wc=24><strong data-gid=epQgg2L-ZO>As skin ages, it can feel lack lustre and less bouncy, how do we counteract that if we can't afford expensive products and treatments?</strong></p><p id=eNZDPG4fO9o data-wc=78>"So, I am a big believer in facial exercises - moving your face a lot while talking and moving the muscles. Short of coming to my office and building up your bones and your muscles, which I love doing and do every day, maintaining a routine and really understanding your skin every day. Just the same way as you tend to your teeth every day, or you brush your hair, this is work you have to educate yourself."&nbsp;</p><p id=e7F2e-V-ltzn data-wc=52><strong>If someone is preparing for a big event (whether it's a wedding day or a big birthday party, or the Oscars) what would your advice be when it comes to your skin in the lead up to the big day? Should you be adding something into your regime or taking something out?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eeh5FjL0sY-8 data-wc=118>"I would say start a few months ahead of the game if you really want flawless, fantastic skin. Use a product with stable Vitamin C for an instant glowing effect, and a serum with hyaluronic acid to plump skin. Getting closer to the time of the event you should have more facials or deeper lasers such as Coolaser. Clay masks help a lot right before the event - perhaps the night before use a clay mask because it'll tighten your skin. I recommend that you don't add a product to your skin that you haven't tried before. That could be a mistake. Don't do anything the day of - just stick to a simple routine and your makeup."</p><a href=# class=buttonWidgetButtonLink_b94rpwz rel="sponsored nofollow"><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/09068d6e27d3-clay-mask.jpg></a><a href=# class="buttonWidgetButton_b1lxbopb buttonClass_by57jsl -primary" rel="sponsored nofollow"><p>START SKIN ANALYSIS</p></a><p id=ehv4Ax-FQZ4e data-wc=36><strong>There's a trend on social media right now - things that are out, and things that are in.

A lot of your celebrity clients live in sunny climates, what do you tell them?</strong></p><p id=eZUeVwdJ_oJV data-wc=128>"I tell them not to do it. You really have to avoid the sun. Sun block is the least you can do, I don't care if you have only been to check the mail, you have to wear sun block, especially in places like LA or Australia, anywhere the sun is very strong. Even when it's cloudy you might not realise how much sun exposure we are under, so wear the sun block. If you're going to be outside a lot, wear a hat and clothing that covers you. If you care about your face, if you care about your beauty, if you care about keeping healthy and as youthful looking as possible, you really have to minimise how much sun exposure you have. It's not a secret."</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/fca298db4072-khloe-kardashian-sunshine.jpg><p id=eDHS1wH1HPWl data-wc=19><strong>What's your thoughts on LED Face Masks? Lots of celebrities love them and we'd love to know your opinion.&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=eLtjB1ZRKuQj data-wc=111>"I love them, they're anti-inflammatory and each light has its own unique target. You can use different lights to treat acne or acne scars, you can treat fine lines and you can boost collagen production. They all do work but they take a little bit of time as you have to sit under the light and most of us are in a rush to go to work but if you have five or ten minutes, they're worth a try. What I will say, is that it's very important to wear the goggles - the lights are bright and you need to cover the lines, you don't want to impact your vision."&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/aa80f0e258c3-kourtney-kardashian-led-mask.jpg><p id=eZedcUV6aesf data-wc=24><strong>It's award season right now, what's the number one treatment or product celebrities are all trying to get their hands on before the Oscars?&nbsp;</strong></p><p id=e0sGkKKBXNRe data-wc=45>"Aside from treatments, a hydrating booster really works very well. My other favourite is the Line Eraser which gets rid of fine lines you have and that works really well for around the eyes and on the neckline to tighten the elasticity of the skin."&nbsp;</p><figure class="quoteClass_qcs0mq1 -category-healthandbeauty -style-2"><p id=e0K9rnwHpuru>"I'm a big believer that what you eat has a big reflection on your skin."</p>Dr Simon Ourian MD</figure><p id=e7KNI7qhv2YL data-wc=21><strong>The gut microbiome is a big talking point here in the UK, how do you think your diet affects your skin?</strong></p><p id=esFinfk2FX-S data-wc=161>"I'm a big believer that what you eat has a big reflection on your skin. You can't eat sugar and fatty foods all day long and hope to have great skin unless you have supernatural genes. Sugar and heavy fatty foods, especially seed oils, are very inflammatory. Your gut health is compromised when you eat foods that are not good for you or not holistic or organic. I am a big believer in it, I eat healthy foods as often as I can, I drink celery juice every day to keep my gut healthy. I hope I don't make too many enemies here, but I don't think dairy is too good for you, especially after the age of 18 or 19, I don't see a real cause for people consuming it past that age. I will make more enemies here but you can add as many nutritious things as you want but a couple of drinks a week destroys it all."&nbsp;</p><h4 class="relatedContentTitleClass_r14hzpr7 hm-heading">You may also like</h4><ul class=relatedContentListClass_ra09n5z><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Martha Stewart, 82, loves this rosewater face mist for glowing skin and it's just $12 on Amazon" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/b32520faeae1-martha-stewart-mario-badescu-facial-spray.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Martha Stewart, 82, loves this rosewater face mist for glowing skin and it's just $12 on Amazon" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Martha Stewart, 82, loves this rosewater face mist for glowing skin and it's just $12 on Amazon</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="I'm 43 & I tried snail mucin for ‘glass skin’ because the TikTokkers told me to - here’s what I honestly think" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/c751611a6cfb-snail-essence.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="I'm 43 & I tried snail mucin for ‘glass skin’ because the TikTokkers told me to - here’s what I honestly think" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>I'm 43 & I tried snail mucin for ‘glass skin’ because the TikTokkers told me to - here’s what I honestly think</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li><li class=relatedContentItemClass_r1rbqie4><a aria-label="Winter has wreaked havoc with my skin so I tried Japanese skincare Tatcha to see if it would make a difference - here’s what happened" class=hm-link href=# rel><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/square/60f460dfde9c-tatcha-tried-and-tested-leanne-bayley.jpg></a><h5 class="miniCardTitle_m1w18s13 hm-heading"><a aria-label="Winter has wreaked havoc with my skin so I tried Japanese skincare Tatcha to see if it would make a difference - here’s what happened" class="miniCardLink_my4jhwq hm-link" href=# rel>Winter has wreaked havoc with my skin so I tried Japanese skincare Tatcha to see if it would make a difference - here’s what happened</a></h5><span class=miniCardLine_m1nt9q7p></span></li></ul><p id=eye2n8E50HJ></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qbHLpaammZeWx6q6xGeaqKVfnbKiuNOhmKeckpqutsDYaGxqbGJnf3Cw0WaqoqWfo3qwwdGimKdlmaPBpr7VopywZZ%2Bjeqyt0Z2YrKCZlru0ecKopqWZo5q%2Fbq3NnWSaoV2psqS0zaijqJ%2BpZA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
