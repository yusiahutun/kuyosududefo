The "As It Was" singer donned a number of Gucci 'fits, many of which were custom, throughout the year, whether he was walking a red carpet or performing.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-8 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Though Styles picked a huge selection of fun Gucci outfits for his Love on Tour shows around the world — like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>this</a>, <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2>this</a> and <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3>this</a> — we chose 10 of our favorite style moments from this year that were from his other appearances. It's hard to narrow it down to 10 when you're doing it like Harry Styles, but these are our favorites.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-rainbow-supreme-on-april-15></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-12 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Rainbow Supreme on April 15</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-13 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Mazur/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-14 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Styles took the stage during weekend one of Coachella wearing a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>custom rainbow paillete jumpsuit</a> by Gucci. When he first stepped on stage, he topped the look with a long black furry coat also from the fashion house. This look kicked off Styles' new era of fashion for 2022.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-pink-and-fabulous-on-april-22></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-16 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Pink and Fabulous on April 22</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-17 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Kevin Mazur/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-18 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Coachella's second weekend, Styles wore a similar fur coat, though this one was different shades of pink. The true star of the show, though, was his outfit underneath. Gucci created an all-pink look of metallic pants, jacket and a vest, embellished with an "H" and "S" on the butt of the pants and fruits on the jacket and vest. He wore the vest open, leaving his many tattoos on display.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-bright-green-on-may-18></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-22 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Bright Green on May 18</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-23 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Harry Styles.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Cindy Ord/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-24 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">As Styles headed into <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>album promo for Harry's House</a>, he continued with the colorful clothing. For an appearance on Howard Stern, Styles chose another custom Gucci look, this one with bright green pants and a ringer tee covered in strawberries. He accessorized with one of his many Eliou necklaces.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-neon-stripes-on-may-19></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-26 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Neon Stripes on May 19</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-27 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Harry Styles.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>James Devaney/GC</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-28 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For a performance on Today, Styles wore this custom JW Anderson jumpsuit, inspired by the designer's Resort 2022 collection. The neon green, brown, and black look featured bell sleeves and a flared leg. The "As It Was" singer completed the look with black Vans that he could run around the (very wet and rainy) stage in.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-30 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Last time Styles appeared on Today, in 2020, he also wore a JW Anderson piece that has since become iconic: the knitted rainbow sweater that inspired fans around the world to knit their own version. To make it easier for them to accomplish, the fashion house published a free pattern online for fans to follow.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-32 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>Never miss a story — sign up for </strong><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow><strong>PEOPLE's free weekly newsletter</strong></a><strong> to get the biggest news of the week delivered to your inbox every Friday.</strong></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gucci-chic-on-sept-4></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-34 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gucci Chic on Sept. 4</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-35 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>BACKGRID</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-36 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For Styles' trip to the Venice Film Festival with the Don't Worry Darling cast, he <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>brought out his new Gucci HA HA HA collection</a> before it was even available to shop. When he arrived in Italy, he wore this elevated casual look with jeans, a sweater vest and jacket, all from his collection. To spice up the look, though, he opted for no shirt under the sweater vest and topped the look off with sunglasses.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-38 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">He also added one of his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1>go-to accessories: a claw clip</a>. He attached his <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Emi Jay Floral Clip</a> to his luggage for safe keeping while he made his way through the crowd.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-effortlessly-cool-on-sept-5></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-40 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Effortlessly Cool on Sept. 5</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-41 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Alessandra Benedetti - Corbis/Corbis via Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-42 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the second of Styles' Gucci HA HA HA looks in Venice, he chose a pinstripe jacket over a white tank with navy blue trousers. He tied a blue scarf around his neck for some flair, and the turquoise stripe in it matched his nail polish perfectly. He left his curly hair effortlessly tousled for this appearance.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-sharply-dressed-on-sept-5></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-46 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Sharply Dressed on Sept. 5</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-47 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Dominique Charriau/WireImage</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-48 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Styles rounded out his Venice Gucci trifecta with a custom blue suit that he paired with white boots from his Gucci HA HA HA collection. Rather than a basic suit, though, this one had all the sharp edges, including exaggerated shoulders and oversize collar points.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-classic-in-pinstripes-on-sept-11></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-50 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Classic in Pinstripes on Sept. 11</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-51 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Matt Winkelmeyer/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-52 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Just days later, Styles crossed the pond for the Toronto International Film Festival with the cast of My Policeman. For a press conference for the film, Styles chose another Gucci HA HA HA look, this time in black and white pinstripe. He, again, went without a shirt under his vest, and accessorized with an orange Eliou necklace.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-gorgeous-in-green-on-sept-11></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-56 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Gorgeous in Green on Sept. 11</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-57 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-portrait figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Geoff Robins / AFP/ Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-58 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the movie's premiere later that day, Styles switched into a brighter Gucci number. He wore a custom look featuring light green trousers and a dark green double-breasted jacket with a silk flower. He finished the look with a Gucci Bamboo 1947 Small Top Handle Bag in a vibrant green shade.</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-suited-and-booted-on-nov-1></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-60 class="comp mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Suited and Booted on Nov. 1</span></h2><figure id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-61 class="comp mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme mntl-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block people-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-text>Harry Styles.</span> <span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Michael Buckner/Getty</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_1-0-62 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Styles looked every bit the vintage policeman his character in My Policeman truly is when he walked the red carpet at the Los Angeles premiere in November. His all-black Gucci Spring 2023 suit had a retro feel, with its band-collar jacket and belted waist.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiolaS9rbGNnKamZ6Opxq2xjqGYq6qpYsC1xcueqmaalajBbr%2FTsqOeZZ2kuqa606xka2hiZ3w%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
