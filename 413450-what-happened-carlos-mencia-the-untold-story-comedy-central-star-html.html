The untold story of the Comedy Central star</h1><div><strong>Publish date: </strong>2024-02-05</div><p class=align-left><strong>Ned Arnel ‘Carlos’ Mencia is a comedian, writer and podcaster. He is famous for <i>Mind of Mencia,</i> one of the lead shows on <i>Comedy Central</i>. The Honduran-born American comedian was recognised for his unique approach to current affairs and his brilliant take on intricate political happenings. But, unfortunately, his show suddenly came to a halt in 2008, after only four seasons.

First, in his prime, many <a href=#>comedians</a>, including the now podcaster Joe Rogan, accused him of stealing and plagiarising their jokes. Second, in 2009, he made racist remarks after Hurricane Katrina, insinuating “black people cannot swim.”</p><h2>Mencia’s exit on TV</h2><p class=align-left>While many <a href=# title>prominent comedians</a> have terminated contracts with <i>Comedy Central</i> in the past two decades, Mencia’s exit was sudden and unexpected. The two reasons why the network ended the <i>Mind of Mencia</i> are:</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a94e67144349a2cb.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Who are rapper Logic's parents? Everything you need to know</span></p></a><h3>Carlos Mencia’s plagiarism claims</h3><p class=align-left>In comedy, originality is sacred. While comedians such as <a href=#>Dave Chappell </a>have confessed giving some of their jokes to their peers, the cases are rare. However, Carlos Mencia is one of the mainstream comedians to have many plagiarism accusations in Hollywood.</p><p class=align-left>In his final season at<i> Mind of Mencia</i>, rumours about him stealing other people’s jokes started floating, especially in the <a href=#>entertainment</a> circles. Although <i>Comedy Central </i>did not release any information on why the show was cancelled, many commentators believe plagiarism was one of the key reasons.</p><p class=align-left>Shortly after exiting the network, <a href=# title rel="nofollow noopener">Joe Rogan interrupted</a> him in the middle of a show at <i>Comedy Store </i>on Sunset Boulevard. According to Rogan, Mencia was stealing his jokes without crediting him. Although Rogan <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">no longer holds a grudge</a> against him, the allegations affected his standup comedy career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/7d408cdf089310d8.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=27><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>What happened to Scott on Counting Cars? What you need to know</span></p></a><p class=align-left>Besides Rogan, George Lopez also accused him of stealing some of his routines. The comedian shared instances where Mencia retold his jokes in his HBO special. Speaking to <i><a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">The Howard Stern Show</a></i>, Lopez proved that the comedian used some of his popular jokes, such as his famous “Taco Bell joke.”</p><h3>Racism allegations</h3><p class=align-left>Mencia has made many controversial statements in his specials and<a href=#> on TV</a>. However, his comments after Hurricane Katrina on blacks not having the ability to swim was unfortunate. While he has since apologised, it remains one of his lowest moments as a comedian.</p><p class=align-left>Shortly after the comment, his name was <a href=# rel="nofollow noopener">dropped by organisers</a> from the lineup which performed at the <i>New Orleans Mardi Gras</i>. Also, being removed from the <i>Krewe of Orpheus </i>lineup was his first significant loss since exiting from TV.</p><p class=align-left>Besides the immediate financial loss, the inappropriate comment made him one of the most hated comedians. Big sponsors such as HBO stopped working with him after big news outlets shared the story. For more than seven years, the blackout affected his career.</p><a class=c-article-read-also__image-wrapper href=#><img sizes=256px style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/63a99ed75b32af00.jpg></a><a class=c-article-read-also__headline href=# readability=30><p class=c-article-read-also__caption>Read also</p><p class=c-article-read-also__headline-wrapper><span class=c-article-read-also__headline-hover-inner>Bryan Callen: divorce story, wife, net worth, latest updates</span></p></a><h2>How did Mencia handle the allegations?</h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/netstorage-tuko.akamaized.net/images/a94e67144349a2cb.jpg><p class=align-left>After exiting on TV, Carlos Mencia’s real name, Ned Arnel Carlos Mencia, became a synonym of evil.
