It usually goes something like this: The first step uses an oil-based cleanser, which is then followed by a water-based cleanser. "The idea is that you should remove the makeup, dirt, sebum, and pollution with an oil-based cleanser first to actually lift up the grime and then cleanse with a gentle foaming or water-based cleanser to further cleanse the pores and wash it all away," explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Dr. Marnie Nussbaum</a>, a board-certified dermatologist in New York City.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The method isn't new. In fact, it is the foundation of every K-beauty skincare routine and has become quite common in the U.S. over the past decade. "In Korea, everyone is obsessed with how to properly cleanse their skin because it's the first step to the final goal: dewy, soft skin," says Charlotte Cho, co-founder of <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Soko Glam</a>. "A proper cleanse is a double cleanse, and neglecting this step would be skin blasphemy! And it's not just a K-beauty staple; many dermatologists recommend the double cleanse as a way to first lift dirt and grime and then properly wash it all away."</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-benefits-of-double-cleansing></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>Benefits of Double Cleansing</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There are two main benefits to double cleansing: effectively removing makeup, dirt, and oil from your skin and helping your skincare products penetrate deeper into the skin. "Double cleansing offers a way to gently but effectively eliminate excess oil and buildup from the skin without vigorous scrubbing or stripping of the skin of its natural oils," says Marisa Garshick, MD, a board-certified dermatologist at MDCS Dermatology. "The first step of a double cleanse, cleansing oils, balms, and oil-based cleansers, are designed to be gentle on the skin. If you tend to wear heavy makeup every day and a traditional cleanser is not enough to remove it, then it may help to double cleanse as part of your evening routine to ensure the makeup is completely removed."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Dr. Nussbaum agrees. She adds that a double cleanse can help your following products penetrate deeper into the skin, which can make those products more efficient.<br></p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-pick-the-right-cleansers></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Pick the Right Cleansers</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_19-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Before diving into how to double cleanse properly, we have to talk about what cleansers to use. First, you need two types of different types: an oil-based cleanser for the first step and a water-based cleanser to use afterward. If you have acne-prone skin, Dr. Garshick says to look for a non-comedogenic oil-based cleanser.</p><p>Those with sensitive or dry skin will want to avoid using a harsh water-based cleanser (such as abrasive scrubs or any harsh soaps) to prevent stripping the skin of its natural oils.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">For the oil-based cleanser, she says to opt for a cleansing oil such as the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>DHC Deep Cleansing Oil</a> or a cleansing balm like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Farmacy Green Clean Makeup Removing Cleansing Balm</a>. For a water-based cleanser, she recommends one with gentle formulations like the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=3 rel=nofollow>La Roche Posay Toleriane Hydrating Facial Cleanser</a> or the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=4 rel=nofollow>Cetaphil Gentle Daily Cleanser</a>.<br></p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner><p>Getty Images</p></span></figure><span class=heading-toc id=toc-how-to-double-cleanse></span><h2 id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-heading mntl-sc-block-heading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-heading__text>How to Double-Cleanse</span></h2><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Start off with an oil-based cleanser to wash away impurities like makeup, dirt, oil, and sunscreen. "In Western skincare, we're often taught to shy away from anything with the word 'oil' for fear it will clog pores or cause acne," says Cho. "However, oil removes oil, so an oil cleanser will help break down and remove excess sebum and oil-based impurities like makeup and sunscreen."</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Cho recommends using a balm like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>The Living Cleansing Balm</a> from her skincare line, Then I Met You. "A balm is my go-to choice — its texture is friendly, less messy, and great to travel with, but texture is purely a personal preference," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Follow up with a water-based cleanser to make sure every last impurity is washed away. Gel or foaming cleansers are great options, but Dr. Nussbaum says that <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>micellar water</a> will do the trick, too. Even though cleansing oils generally won't cause breakouts, if you have acne-prone or extremely oily skin, Dr. Nussbaum suggests using a micellar water emulsion as your first step, followed by a foaming cleanser like <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>CeraVe's Foaming Facial Cleanser</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's also important to remember to "spend a few minutes working the cleanser into the skin and include the eye area," says <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Joanna Vargas</a>, celebrity facialist and founder of Joanna Vargas Salons and Skincare. "Small circles are the best way to make sure you loosen the makeup and dirt. Splash, then rinse. You can use a washcloth for the cleanse if you want a gentle exfoliation, but be sure to wash the cloth after every use."</p><span class=heading-toc id=toc-frequently-asked-questions-5b11334b-365f-463a-b9a5-803b76826f72></span><h2 class=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__title>Frequently Asked Questions</h2><ul id=mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content_1-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block-universal-faq__content mntl-accordion js-accordion" readability=51><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=1 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Should you double cleanse every day?</span></p><p>Dr. Garshick says that you can double cleanse every day if you wear heavy makeup and if your skin can take it. If you feel your skin starts to feel dry or stripped, it's best to do in a couple of times a week instead.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=2 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Can you double cleanse twice a day?</span></p><p>The short answer? No. "For most people, double cleansing at night is the perfect balance to avoid over-cleansing and causing irritation, especially as you are not typically removing makeup in the morning," says Dr. Nussbaum. In the morning, water or micellar water is sufficient enough to wash away any oil that your skin has built up overnight.</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=3 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>Will an oil cleanser cause breakouts?</span></p><p>It can, especially if you're acne-prone. Dr, Garshick says it is best to look for a product that is non-comedogenic to ensure it won’t clog the pores or lead to breakouts.&nbsp;</p></li><li class="accordion__item js-accordion-item is-active" data-ordinal=4 readability=-1><p><span class=accordion__title>What skin types should be double cleansing?</span></p><p>Dr. Garshick says double cleansing is most helpful for those who wear a lot of makeup or anyone who has oily skin. She goes on to say that while double cleansing can be performed by all skin types, she cautions those with dry or sensitive skin as it may cause dryness and irritation.</p></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZMSprdNmoKxllKTCo7jEZpqlnZGjwKq6xmaqpKGe</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
