If every person made even just one small change to how they consume fashion; opting for secondhand, renting one-off pieces for special occasions or recycling their clothes after they're done with them, it would make a huge difference. "It’s better for everyone to be one per cent better than one person to be 100 per cent better," says Foster.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=8 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">Below, we chat to the designer about her concerns over the denim industry, how things have changed since starting her label and her advice for building a greener wardrobe.</p><h2 data-node-id=9 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Why is the denim industry, in particular, harmful to the planet?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=11 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"For decades the denim industry has been exhausting the environment with its intense water, dyeing and texturing processes [when jeans are manipulated to imitate natural rips and fade]. Coupled with the extreme mass scale of denim production, I felt there was a real need to address the over-abundant supply not being utilised. As a world population, we produce four billion pairs of jeans a year, the majority of which are discarded.</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=13 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Just because the size, shape or condition makes the jeans undesirable it doesn’t mean that the denim material itself doesn’t have value and shouldn’t mean the material is rendered unusable. Rigid denim was originally designed as a working fabric and is made to last. Therefore, it’s the perfect material to rework, giving it a new life in sophisticated and timeless silhouettes and allowing it to attain its perfect potential."</p><h2 data-node-id=14 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What should customers look out for when shopping for sustainable denim?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=16 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Always choose rigid denim, which is denim fabric woven from 100 per cent cotton fibres without any additions of elastane. Stretch denim will always eventually lose shape, so people end up discarding them and buying another pair which creates a viscous cycle. All E.L.V. Denim jeans are made from upcycled rigid denim, and we also incorporate couture tailoring into our designs to ensure jeans are the perfect fit. Our recognisable design is not only an aesthetic one, but also a functional one, as the four seams have an allowance which means you can easily take in or out your jeans according to your life."</p><img alt="a man in a blue shirt" title="E.L.V Denim" width=1365 height=2048 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/e-l-v-resort-24-dsc09393-65671f1e015a9.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Arash Davoodi</span></p><h2 data-node-id=18 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What do you think needs to change in the fashion industry?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=20 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We need to encourage others to <a href=# data-vars-ga-outbound-link=https://www.harpersbazaar.com/uk/fashion/what-to-wear/a36050267/sustainable-denim-guide/ data-vars-ga-ux-element=Hyperlink data-vars-ga-call-to-action="champion local manufacturing and slow fashion." class="body-link css-1gunp80 emevuu60">champion local manufacturing and slow fashion.</a> I'm proud to be a thought leader in this space, however, this journey is not just for me and E.L.V.

Denim was born from an ethos of conscious design, local manufacturing, and slow production. We don’t use any new, virgin material in any of our designs ensuring that we have zero impact on the environment. However, we are constantly raising our standards and always trying to be better. We have invested in innovation so we are able to upcycle textiles from other industries besides denim, and we proudly launched our 'White Collection' last summer, taking damaged linen from the luxury hotel industry. Just like denim, this sumptuous linen can have a new life and a story.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=24 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"We are now collecting all our threads and tiny little scraps and turning them into our swing tags and we save all the old buttons and rivets and are working to turn them into 'Objet d’art' – even our waste can become items of beauty."</p><img alt="a person with the hand up" title="E.L.V Denim " width=1998 height=3000 decoding=async data-nimg=1 sizes=100vw src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/hips.hearstapps.com/hmg-prod/images/e-l-v-resort-24-aa004-65671fa9141f1.jpg style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center><p><span class="css-1urwh1q e1geg53v2">Arash Davoodi</span></p><h2 data-node-id=26 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">Do you think our attitudes to fashion have changed since you started your brand? If so, how?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=28 class="body-text css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"I have certainly seen a change in attitudes in the last five years. When I launched the brand in 2018 there were relatively few people championing an environmental shift in the industry, but now we are actively seeing a change in mindset. Customers are now mindful of how harmful the fashion industry can be and that there are alternatives, they are looking for brands that embody an ethical ethos from its core. People are also seeking transparency and individuality, and by upcycling vintage denim each E.L.V. Denim jeans has its own unique characteristics which are inherently one of a kind. Coupled with our couture tailoring, we create handcrafted luxury items that last a lifetime and that is certainly something to be celebrated."</p><h6 class="css-ok56rr e94w1mj3"><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p0"></span><span class="css-8lle59 e94w1mj1">Related Story</span><span aria-hidden=true class="css-0 eagam8p1"></span></h6><h2 data-node-id=30 class="body-h3 css-11vz3s8 emevuu60">What advice would you give to those wanting to make their business sustainable?</h2><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=32 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Ask questions all the time; the main being can we do better? A sustainable business is one that puts community, design and quality over pure profit. Those are high standards to maintain but if you know your business is creating products of high quality which are desirable and designed to last, then these are the foundations for longevity and

We all can reason that purchasing a locally made upcycled handcrafted brand is better socially, economically, and environmentally.

We are all aware of greenwashing and it’s not always easy to decipher, but a quick look at the content on the brand's website is a fairly good indication of how dedicated they are. I would encourage people who are trying to act more eco-conscious to be more wary of fabric said to be made from recycled bottles – there aren’t enough bottles of the correct plastic to make the amount of material that is advertised.</p><p data-journey-content=true data-node-id=43 class="css-1nd4gv7 emevuu60">"Additionally, denim which claims to be ‘recycled’.
