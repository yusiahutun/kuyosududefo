"They've been emailing for a while, and she hinted they should get together." According to the source, Hedlund met Swift around 8PM and made it back to his hotel room, alone, by 12:30 AM.</p><p>As someone who can have her pick of pretty much any guy she wishes, Swift is smart to go after the hunky actor, who has had starring roles in 'Friday Night Lights,' 'Tron: Legacy,' and 'Country Strong.' Though, this time around, the 21-year-old singer is not being "swift" and wants to really know how this guy ticks. "She has actually spent time getting to know Garrett," the inside source says.</p><p>Not to mention, Hedlund is currently in Nashville recording his debut album, so he and his 'Love Story' lady could make beautiful music together! The unnamed source adds, "He's cute -- and he's into country music! [She] likes that he's a normal guy." We don't necessarily agree that Mr. Hedlund is just your average Joe, but we like that our blonde heroine is on the hunt for a good guy -- she deserves it!</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiskajBprvFnKaupqSnxm%2BvzqZmrZmpobyzedKwoJ%2BsXZyus77EratmoJWZuba6w2almquYq7atuMRo</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>.
