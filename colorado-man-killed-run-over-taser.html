"This man took responsibility to pull the trigger, to incapacitate my kid for 5 seconds," his father said to <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>NBC</strong></a>. "Look down stream, there's a car coming!"</p><p>"When you tase someone on a highway, it is a death sentence. It is by definition," Siddhartha Rathod, one of the attorneys representing the family, told <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>CBS</strong></a>. "You know what is going to happen, and that is that they are going to be run over by a car."</p><p>"This isn't even the type of situation where the officer should chase someone. He knew who he was. It was a ticketable offense. It was a traffic violation," Rathod continued. "And chasing someone onto I-25 alone is dangerous enough. It's dangerous for drivers. But tazing someone on I-25 is insane and it's criminal."</p><p>In a statement, Sheriff John Feyen said, "As first responders dedicated to helping others, we grieve the loss of life in any situation. This incident is no exception, and multiple lives have been changed forever. Nobody wanted this outcome. I've met with the Thompson family and their representatives. Losing a loved one is heartbreaking, and I'm truly saddened by the loss they’re experiencing."</p><p>Another attorney representing the family, however, <a href=# rel="noopener noreferrer"><strong>told the Denver Gazette</strong></a> they believe the Sheriff's Office is "more concerned with smearing the name of Brent," after they shared they found drugs in both Thompson's system and the vehicle after the incident.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmisn6Szoq6NnKamZ2Jlf3R7j3Bma3BfmLytu9Gam6hlnZa7brfIpaOenF2nwq95zq%2Bcq2WklsCmvo4%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
