There are mauves, browns, and beiges, a nod to the colors Beckham personally wore during her Spice Girl days, but there is also a berry and red for anyone who's into a bold lip.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The formula offers rich color, a hint of shine, and wears comfortably (even if you're like me and wearing a mask dries out your lips) thanks to a blend of deeply moisturizing oils (rosehip, avocado, and coconut) and waxes (candelilla, carnauba, and sunflower).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_9-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While Sway is the ideal your-lips-but-better pink I always gravitate towards, as it starts to feel more like fall in New York, I can't help but swipe on Play, a decadent plum berry.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Posh Lipstick in Sway</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_12-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To buy: </strong>$38; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow">victoriabeckhambeauty.com</a>.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_14-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>Posh Lipstick in Play</span></h3><figure id=mntl-sc-block_15-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-square figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Courtesy</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_16-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>To buy: </strong>$38; <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow">victoriabeckhambeauty.com</a>.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">When it comes to wearing lipstick, I typically reserve dark or bright shades for special occasions, because I hate the fuss of having to check or reapply if my lipstick is on my teeth, my cheek, or has completely faded. But this emollient formula is the closest thing to a low-maintenance bold lip color because it feels fresh and smooth on my lips the entire time I have it on.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><strong>VIDEO: Beauty School: How to Get Fuller Lips</strong></p><p id=mntl-sc-block_24-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">With the stress and uncertainty this new decade has brought upon us so far, it's natural that we're finding comfort in TV shows, music, and even beauty trends from the past. And I'll never forget the first time I saw the Spice Girls "Wannabe" music video. I was nine-years-old, watching MuchMusic video countdown (the Canadian version of MTV) in my room. The girls exuded confidence and their outfits were unlike anything I had seen in my Canadian town. I was an instant fan and collected every piece of Spice Girls memorabilia I could coerce my mom into buying for me, from Chupa Chups lollipops, to photo cards.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_26-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Now, whenever I swipe on this '90s-inspired lipstick in my tiny New York apartment, which has also become my office and gym during the pandemic, I'm mentally transported back to a time that seems so much simpler. And that warm nostalgic feeling is worth $38 a tube.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html"><i><a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=internalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=noreferrer>The Splurge</a> is our recurring column dedicated to expensive beauty products that are actually worth it. </i><i>This week, why we're rebuying <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel="sponsored noopener noreferrer nofollow">Victoria Beckham Beauty Posh Lipstick</a></i><i>, despite the $38 price tag.</i></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLqit8Sup2iumZjBsL7ImmSbnZOgtaK5jJucmq2krnqxu9KhZKWhoKjBqq%2FKZqmerpmaxA%3D%3D</p><footer class=site-footer><span class=site-footer-credits>Made with <a href=https://gohugo.io/>Hugo</a>. © 2022.
